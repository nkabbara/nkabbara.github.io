# How to Write This Article? Who is it for? What purpose will it serve?

The purpose:

1. So you learn go better. Documenting your learning and how you're changing things around so you better absorb the material.
2. So you can learn future programming languages more effectively

::date2021/12/27 you don't have a clear picture as of now on how to write this. Keep loggin daily observersions to see if this will amount to something.
You've just finishe a spanking new project and the power's that be, decided to standardize
the whole organization into one programming language: Go

You have three weeks to learn enough go so you're NOT dangerous.

How to proceed?

### Plan V1

You were signed up to a subscription to Ultimate Go as a way of learning the language.

Naturally, you'll start watching the vidoes, taking notes and working the examples

### Plan V2

You feel like something is missing. That that's not enough, so you publicize your notes
organization wide in order to hold yourself accountable with your learning.

Still, something is missing.

### Plan V3

Oh shit. Learning a programming language is similar in many ways to learning a spoken language. ie. The way to
learn it is to speak it. Or to program in it.

So the updated plan

1. Watch a video from Ultimage Go
2. Rewatch, synthesize and publish notes
3. Do a section from Learg Go With Tests
4. Repeat

Currently, this seems to be effective. Let's see.

Go to https://quii.gitbook.io/learn-go-with-tests/ and finish a section

### Plan V4

1. Watch a whole section from start to finish. Very minimal notes if any.
2. Do a section from Learg Go with tests

Next day:

1. Re-watch yesterday's sectoin, but with pauses and notes. Slower? Faster? Same speed?
2. Do a section from learning go with tests.

Currently, this seems to be effective. Let's see.

Go to https://quii.gitbook.io/learn-go-with-tests/ and finish a section

### Plan V5

Watching a whole section is starting to exhaust you. You think it's because of watchign someone talk.

Revised plan:

1. Morning, finish section or two from tdd. Then
1. Load sections code and material into remakable.
1. Watch section while screen is turned off and follow on remarkable.
1. Take nots on remarkable as you pause vid
1. Write notes for consumption

## Spaced Repetition

- Every two days, review a section's note and mark it as completed in the review log

## Notes

- You like the Data Oriented desing philosophy of go
- You like how it has one looping structure
- You don't like how you'll have to sort a map
- You're still trying to understand how memory is store
- Allocation means it's on the heap right? Not just ont he stack? What are people saying when they say it allocates? Why are they worried about that?
- You're still grasping the decoupling stuff.
- You like how the emphasis is on the concrete.

## Learning Log

#### 2021/12/29

Followed more or less v5 for maps in tdd and packaging in ultamate go.

#### 2021/12/27 - 52

- Watched errors section from start to finish. Wrote some notes. You think that might work out better as you have the shape of the error section in your head. Diving into the details tomorrow might be more productive. Let's see tomorrow.
- Finished pointer & erro section in tdd

### 2021/12/22

- Finished 3 lessons in vids. You think 3 are left that are smaller. These are about decoupling and esign.
- [note] rewatch this section and recode the examples. It's an important one.
- You finished ac ouple of sections in TDD

### 2021/12/21

- Finished 4 sessions.
  - Value and pointer semantics with pointer slices
  - (forgetting name) putting a type inside another type without naming it so outer type can use its behavior (outer inner type)
  - Exporting names from packages
  - Grouping types
- Wrote TDD for ints
- [note]: you're concerned the vids might be forgotten after you go deeper in code. How not to? Are notes enough?
