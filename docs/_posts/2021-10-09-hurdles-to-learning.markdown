You're excited to learn a subject and all the incentives are right. Still, you're going to
face challenges. It's the way of the brain.

### Imaginary End Image

You often start with a false end image when you go over new material about a subject that you want to learn. Say a book.
You picture yourself in the future, when you're done reading it, with extra abilities[^1].

But this is a false image to harbor. Because when you're done, you most likely will not have acquired those imagined abilities.
Which will result in disappointment. We don't want disappointment while learning. We want constant motivation and fun.

So we must set a proper expectation.

A better end image to harbor would be to imagine your abilities just as they are now, but with a few changes:

1. You will have better questions to ask.
2. Your mind will see more patterns related to what you've learned.
3. You will have a better idea about where to go next for more.

More hurdles to come...
