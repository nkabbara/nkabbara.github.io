You probably view yourself as a central entity with different parts that need tending.

There's you, say Nash, in the middle, and around are a plethora of parts that you need to
take care of. There's the physical part: excercise, eat healthy, sleep well. There's the financial
part: save more, know where your money goes, plan retirement. There's the spiritual part, the emotinal part,
the relationship part and so on.

You, Nash in the middle, need to take care of all these parts that make you up. Nash feels proud when he's taken care
of his physical needs. He feels safe when he's taken care of his savings. He feels connected when he's done his spiritual
habits. It's all Nash.

But what if you could view yoursels in a completely different way...
