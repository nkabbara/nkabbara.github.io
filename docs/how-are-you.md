_This is not an attempt at philosophy. It's purely subjective. The second person
in my articles is not the conventional one. Itâ€™s referring to one of the me's described here._

When you think of yourself, you probably envision yourself at the bullseye of a circle with
different parts. These parts are what make you who you are.
Usually, these are: the physical part, the emotional part, the professional part, etc...

Each of these parts will have some tasks for you to complete. And when you do, you're supposed
to feel more fulfilled. More you.

The physical part will have something like exercise three times a week, eat healthy
meals on weekdays. The emotional part might have something like meditate for thirty minutes a day,
tell the people that you love, that you love them.

This view of yourself has problems.

**First, it centers _you_ at the middle of it all.** As you workout and meditate and communicate your love
consistently over the years, it will increase the resolution of the _you_ in the center. You _become_ the fit,
contemplative, loving person.

<img src="/assets/hey-you-in-the-middle.png" height="400" style="float: right;">

The problem with that identification is that as soon as you can't do the things that you thought made you
_you_, your identity is shaken.

Not being able to work out anymore due to a chronic injury will change _you_
from fit, contemplative, loving to unfit, contemplative and loving. This blow to your identity could manifest
in detrimental ways starting from unproductive habits to depression.

**Second, it is overwhelming to be the conductor in the center running the whole show.** Everyday of every year, until you the day you die,
you have to tend to all the parts at all times under the pressure of your identity. Your center _you_.

Not tending to one of the parts feels bad. Like a ding in your identity's armor.

(maybe replace #2 with conflic resolution between parts. How can it be done if it's the same part?)

**Finally, the you-centric model does not match with how things feel in reality.** Observe yourself in the following situations:

- Hanging out with a close friend
- Hanging out with your boss
- Under extreme stress
- Alone in your living room staring at the ceiling
- Very hungry
- Making love

Do these feel like the same _you_ in the center, but with a different mood? Or the do they feel more like a **completely different person?**

How you think about things matters. If you think about them incorrectly, you'll end up spending a lot of energy
on exceptions to make things fit into your thinking. Solar system math pre Galileo was littered with many
complicated exceptions in order to justify the sun's orbit around the earth. All those exceptions became unnecessary
after his discoveries. Things naturally fell into place without the need for exceptions.

Maybe in the same way, moving away from the you-centric model, might change the wind to your advantage in how you interact with the world.

A friend, an infectologist, recently described to me a situation which encapsulates all the problems with the you-centric view.

She said that whenever she's with a patient, she feels like a fraud. She has to abandon her true self, the fun and loving person that
she knows and wear a mask. The mask hides _her_ and shows a matter-of-fact and an emotionally unconnected doctor. She can't show
her fun side because her patients are usally in very serious condtions. And she can't show her love because she said that it could
affect her judgement.

Her conflict arises not only from the fact that she's not being her normal self when she's with patients. But strangely, it's from the
fact that her normal fun and loving self loves her job, but when she's in her mask, she doesn't care for it at all.

Are there alternatives?

Instead of the you-centric view, you may want consider viewing the world from
the perspective of one of a multitude of selves. Each with its own wants,
needs and disposition to the world [^1].

One way to start experimenting with this view is to notice which set of behaviors
constantly show themselves in your life and name them. For example:

- Father Self
- Business Owner Self
- Barista Self
- Professional Self
- Obsessive Self

_(Maybe follow a pattern of story/explanation below as you go along)_

Once you've named them, then it becomes easier to notice who's in charge of your world
at any given time.

When you're hanging out with your kids, it might be the Father Self that's occupying
the leadership position. You're nurturing, protective, loving and playful. And
when your kid accidentally punches you in the nose, your Fight-or-Flight Self takes
over and suddently, you're angry, upset and aggressive. Until the Father Self takes
over again.

Note, in this model, there is no You Self and no single self in charge at all times. There are just
these different groups of behaviors that you've named.

After playing with this for a while and being able to easily tell which self is charge, you can take
things a step further and start summoning the optimal self for the given
situation. The goal is always to make all your selves content in the long run.

A friend of mine is one of those perfectionist baristas that makes coffee at a specialty
coffee shop. He happens to be the owner as well. Whenever a customer complains about his
'perfect' espresso, he removes the barista hat (Barista Self) and puts on the
professional hat (Professional Self) and remakes the shot, imperfectly, for the
customer's enjoyment. With a smile.

Although his passion is making coffee, he's able to summon the
right self at the right time in order to satisfy all his selves: His Father Self to be
able to provide for his kids. His Business Owner Self to maintain and solid P&L. His
Porfessional Self and Barista Self will compromise: make the perfect espresso for
the connasoeurs, and make the regular ones for everyone else.

A friend of mine owns a coffee shop. His passion is making perfect espressos. He
sources his coffee from a mountain in Mexico where the height and conditions are
perfect. His store is decked with La Marzocco equipment, think the Ferarri of coffee machines.

When a customer complains about his coffee, he responds in a way where
you wouldn't think that that is the same person that can
identify a coffee bean just by smelling it. He responds with complete agreement
and asks the clueless customer how he'd like his espresso. And when the customer says,
he wants it more like Starbucks' cofee, he doesn't ask the customer to leave the store.
Instead, he happily makes him a bad espresso.

When I asked him about this he said when a customer complains about his drinks, he does not
encourage the Barista Self to take charge, instead, he encourages the Professional Self.
Otherwise the situation would turn into an espresso snobery debate and the customer
into a one timer. But when he's actually making the espresso, he invokes his passion
by summoning the Barista Self. The same self that stays at the shop late into
the night experimenting with different beans, grind levels and temperatures.

The Professional self is, in a way, a completely different creature from the Barista Self.
The first is charming and serves at the pleasure of the customer. The Barista Self is focused,
scientific and obsessive.

When a customer complains, he summons the Professional Self and as professionals do, actualize the purpose
of their profession. In this case, to give the customer their caffein in any way the customer wants it. The Professional
Self is the one that also opens the store on time, and stays later if there are customers still around.
The Teacher Self shows up when an employee is having a hard time and needs help improving.

This becomes interesting when conflicts arise between selves.

My friend again: when he wears his business hat (Business Self), he clearly sees that he can order beans from another farmer that
is 20% cheaper, increasing his profits substantially. But then he wears his Barista Hat (Barista Self) and he knows that this is
going to make less than perfect espressos. What shall he do? Which self should he listen to?

When conflicts arise between selves, the only solution is collaboration in solving problems.
You will never get rid of yourselves. They're always going to be in you. So you must resolve
conflicts for everyone to get their fair share of the floor.

### Later

- So who is really you? Here comes the disucssion of self. Meaning if it's not hte center you. Even the many yous, which one is it. The you!
- Maybe one of the benefits. Not viewing yourself, but viewing the world. This distinction will is important and will become clear later.
- Modify example paragraph with the hats analogy
- when learning self is in charge, then ego self has the least say.
- Compatible selves. If someone is behing directed purely by ego self, then which self do you need to pull out? Definitely not your ego self.
- Read this out loud when done. Re-edit.
- This can become detrimental if you think about it too much
