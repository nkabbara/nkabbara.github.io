_This is not an attempt at philosophy. It's purely subjective. The second person
in my articles is not the conventional one. Itâ€™s referring to one of the me's described here._

When you think of yourself, you probably envision yourself at the bullseye of a circle with
different parts. These parts are what make you who you are.
Usually, these are: the physical part, the emotional part, the professional part, etc...

Each of these parts will have some tasks for you to complete. And when you do, you're supposed
to feel more fulfilled. More you.

The physical part will have something like exercise three times a week, eat healthy
meals on weekdays. The emotional part might have something like meditate for thirty minutes a day,
tell the people that you love, that you love them.

This view of yourself has problems.

**First, it centers _you_ at the middle of it all.** As you workout and meditate and communicate your love
consistently over the years, it will increase the resolution of the _you_ in the center. You _become_ the fit,
contemplative, loving person.

The problem with that identification is that as soon as you can't do the things that you thought made you
_you_, your identity is shaken.

Not being able to work out anymore due to a chronic injury will change _you_
from fit, contemplative, loving to unfit, contemplative and loving. This blow to your identity could manifest
in detrimental ways starting from unproductive habits to depression.

**Second, it is overwhelming to be the conductor in the center running the whole show.** Everyday of every year, until you the day you die,
you have to tend to all the parts at all times under the pressure of your identity. Your center _you_.

Not tending to one of the parts feels bad. Like a ding in your identity's armor.

**Finally, the you-centric model does not match with how things feel in reality.** Observe yourself in the following situations:

- Hanging out with a close friend
- Hanging out with your boss
- Under extreme stress
- Alone in your living room staring at the ceiling
- Very hungry
- Making love

Do these feel like the same _you_ in the center, but with a different mood? Or the do they feel more like a **completely different person?**

How you think about things matters. If you think about them incorrectly, you'll end up spending a lot of energy
on exceptions to make things fit into your thinking. Solar system math pre Galileo was littered with many
complicated exceptions in order to justify the sun's orbit around the earth. All those exceptions became unnecessary
after his discoveries. Things naturally fell into place without the need for exceptions.

A doctor once described to me how conflicted she feels when she's with a patient. She feels like she's not being herself and like she's acting
a role. She said outside the hospital, she felt like she's a loving person with a light sense of humor. But when with a patient, she had to
cover up the real her with stoic mask. The conflict stemmed from her not feeling comfortable conducting her session with humor due to the patient
usual severe situations and that love felt like it could affect her professional judgement. But simultaenously, it felt wrong to hide the
true and real her in order to help the patient. To do her job that she loved in her normal self, she had to become someone else, that didn't necessarily
love that job [wip paragraph. Refine].
