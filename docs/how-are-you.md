_This is not philosophy. It's purely subjective. Mostly, the second person in my writing is usually referring to one of my me(s). Not you the reader._

You probably view yourself as a central entity with different parts that need constant tending.

There's capital You in the middle, and around your You are a plethora of parts and subparts that you need to
take care of. The most common ones that you see in books and literature are The Physical part, Emotional part, the Spiritual part, etc...

The You in the middle, needs to take care of all these parts that make you up. The You feels proud when he's taken care
of his physical needs. He feels safe when he's taken care of his savings. He feels connected when he's done his spiritual
habits. It's all Nash.

There are detrimental consequences to this view of the self.
