_This is not an attempt at philosophy. It's purely subjective. The second person
in my articles is not the conventional one. Itâ€™s referring to one of the me's described here._

When you think of yourself, you probably envision yourself at the bullseye of a circle with
different parts. These parts are what make you who you are.
Usually, these are: the physical part, the emotional part, the professional part, etc...

Each of these parts will have some tasks for you to complete. And when you do, you're supposed
to feel more fulfilled. More you.

The physical part will have something like exercise three times a week, eat healthy
meals on weekdays. The emotional part might have something like meditate for thirty minutes a day,
tell the people that you love, that you love them.

This view of yourself has problems.

**First, it centers _you_ at the middle of it all.** As you workout and meditate and communicate your love
consistently over the years, it will increase the resolution of the _you_ in the center. You _become_ the fit,
contemplative, loving person.

<img src="/assets/hey-you-in-the-middle.png" height="400" style="float: right;">

The problem with that identification is that as soon as you can't do the things that you thought made you
_you_, your identity is shaken.

Not being able to work out anymore due to a chronic injury will change _you_
from fit, contemplative, loving to unfit, contemplative and loving. This blow to your identity could manifest
in detrimental ways starting from unproductive habits to depression.

**Second, it is overwhelming to be the conductor in the center running the whole show.** Everyday of every year, until you the day you die,
you have to tend to all the parts at all times under the pressure of your identity. Your center _you_.

Not tending to one of the parts feels bad. Like a ding in your identity's armor.

(maybe replace #2 with conflic resolution between parts. How can it be done if it's the same part?)

**Finally, the you-centric model does not match with how things feel in reality.** Observe yourself in the following situations:

- Hanging out with a close friend
- Hanging out with your boss
- Under extreme stress
- Alone in your living room staring at the ceiling
- Very hungry
- Making love

Do these feel like the same _you_ in the center, but with a different mood? Or the do they feel more like a **completely different person?**

How you think about things matters. If you think about them incorrectly, you'll end up spending a lot of energy
on exceptions to make things fit into your thinking. Solar system math pre Galileo was littered with many
complicated exceptions in order to justify the sun's orbit around the earth. All those exceptions became unnecessary
after his discoveries. Things naturally fell into place without the need for exceptions.

Maybe in the same way, moving away from the you-centric model, might change the wind to your advantage in how you interact with the world.

A friend, an infectologist, recently described to me a situation which encapsulates all the problems with the you-centric view.

She said that whenever she's with a patient, she feels like a fraud. She has to abandon her true self, the fun and loving person that
she knows and wear a mask. The mask hides _her_ and shows a matter-of-fact and an emotionally unconnected doctor. She can't show
her fun side because her patients are usally in very serious condtions. And she can't show her love because she said that it could
affect her judgement.

Her conflict arises not only from the fact that she's not being her normal self when she's with patients. But strangely, it's from the
fact that her normal fun and loving self loves her job, but when she's in her mask, she doesn't care for it at all.

Are there alternatives?

Instead of the you-centric view, you may want consider viewing the world from
the perspective of one of a multitude of selves. Each with its own wants,
needs and disposition to the world [^1].

One way to start experimenting with this view is to notice which set of behaviors
constantly show themselves in your life and name them. For example:

- Father Self
- Husband Self
- Professional Self
- Business Owner Self
- Obsessive Self

_(Maybe follow a pattern of story/explanation below as you go along)_

Once you've named them, then it becomes easier to notice who's in charge of your world
at different times.

When you're hanging out with your kids, it might be the Father Self that's occupying
the leadership position. You're nurturing, protective, loving and playful. And
when your kid accidentally punches you in the nose, your Fight-or-Flight Self takes
over and suddently, you're angry, upset and aggressive. Until the Father Self takes
over again.

In this model, there is no You Self and no single self in charge at all times. There are just
these different selves that you've named and each is in charge at different times.

After playing with this for a while and being able to easily tell which self is charge, you can take
things a step further and start summoning the optimal self for the given
situation. The ultimate goal is making sure that all your selves are fulfilled because
they're doing what they're good at for the given situation.

An aqaintance of mine is an engineer that works on projects that impact millions of users.
At times, he has to perform mission ciritlca tasks while a dozen colleagues are
watching every step he's taking. He said that these situations always start with the wrong
self in charge. It's usually the Professional Self that wants to maintain a certain image,
or the Over Cautions Self enumerating all the bad things that could happen. My friend said
that he has to actively take a step back and invite the Engineer Self to take the floor.
The calm, stoic and calculating self that can run the show with steady hands.

As you can see from my friend's example, naming selves and learning how to summon
them for their proper role, implies an interaction between the selves. It's a dynamic
partnership, where when one is needed, they take charge, but they're not hugnry for power.
They give the floor when they know another self is better suited for the role.

You can develop a duo, or trio or a quartent of selves that are present at all times with
one of them holding the fort at a time. They switch duty as needed and when needed.

In my friend's example, at work, he has the Engineer Self to handle the technical tasks. When those
are done, the Professional Self takes over to handle the results of the work. And finally the
Social Self might take over to go out and celebrate. A trio that occupies his space while at work.
When he arrives home, another set of selves take over: The Father Self, The Husband Self, The Writer Self
and the Leisure Self. The afterwork quartet interchaning leadership.

It's always a good idea to take a breath and ask: which self is in charge now?
Especially when things aren't going your way. When you're writing and your
daughter is nagging at you to get dinner ready you may respond as the annoyed Writer
Self or the nurturing Father Self. Which one will make all of your selves more content?

This framing of selves removes the center you so there's no an overwhelming feeling
of pressure to do a million things. Instead, it's different selves doing what's best
for them at the right time.

The conflict that my doctor friend felt with her patients can resolve itself in this
framework. As a Doctor Self, she can assume the proper attitude and do what's best
for her patients. The Doctor Self might grow and learn how to show love and be fun
without losing jeapordising her mission. When she leaves the hospital she summons
her Social Self and does what's best for that self. In reality everything is the same
for the exception of how she feels about it all. This release of energy that
was occupying her mind, makes room for growth.

### Later

- So who is really you? Here comes the disucssion of self. Meaning if it's not hte center you. Even the many yous, which one is it. The you!
- Maybe one of the benefits. Not viewing yourself, but viewing the world. This distinction will is important and will become clear later.
- Modify example paragraph with the hats analogy
- when learning self is in charge, then ego self has the least say.
- Compatible selves. If someone is behing directed purely by ego self, then which self do you need to pull out? Definitely not your ego self.
- Read this out loud when done. Re-edit.
- This can become detrimental if you think about it too much
