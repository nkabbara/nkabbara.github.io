_This is not an attempt at philosophy. It's purely subjective. The second person
in my articles is not the conventional one. It’s referring to one of the me's described here._

When you think of yourself, you probably envision yourself at the bullseye of a circle with
different parts. These parts are what make you who you are.
Usually, these are: the physical part, the emotional part, the professional part, etc...

Each of these parts will have some tasks for you to complete. And when you do, you're supposed
to feel more fulfilled. More you.

The physical part will have something like exercise three times a week, eat healthy
meals on weekdays. The emotional part might have something like meditate for thirty minutes a day,
tell the people that you love, that you love them.

This view of yourself has problems.

**First, it centers _you_ at the middle of it all.** As you workout and meditate and communicate your love
consistently over the years, it will increase the resolution of the _you_ in the center. You _become_ the fit,
contemplative, loving person.

The problem with that identification is that as soon as you can't do the things that you thought made you
_you_, your identity is shaken.

Not being able to work out anymore due to a chronic injury will change _you_
from fit, contemplative, loving to unfit, contemplative and loving. This blow to your identity could manifest
in detrimental ways starting from unproductive habits to depression.

**Second, it is overwhelming to be the conductor in the center running the whole show.** Everyday of every year, until you the day you die,
you have to tend to all the parts at all times under the pressure of your identity. Your center _you_.

Not tending to one of the parts feels bad. Like a ding in your identity's armor.

**Finally, the you-centric model does not match with how things feel in reality.** Observe yourself in the following situations:

- Hanging out with a close friend
- Hanging out with your boss
- Under extreme stress
- Alone in your living room staring at the ceiling
- Very hungry
- Making love

Do these feel like the same _you_ in the center, but with a different mood? Or the do they feel more like a **completely different person?**

How you think about things matters. If you think about them incorrectly, you'll end up spending a lot of energy
on exceptions to make things fit into your thinking. Solar system math pre Galileo was littered with many
complicated exceptions in order to justify the sun's orbit around the earth. All those exceptions became unnecessary
after his discoveries. Things naturally fell into place without the need for exceptions.

Maybe in the same way, moving away from the you-centric model, might change the wind to your advantage in how you interact with the world.

A friend, an infectologist, recently described to me a situation which encapsulates all the problems with the you-centric view.

She said that whenever she's with a patient, she feels like a fraud. She has to abandon her true self, the fun and loving person that
she knows and wear a mask. The mask hides _her_ and shows a matter-of-fact and an emotionally unconnected doctor. She can't show
her fun side because her patients are usally in very serious condtions. And she can't show her love because she said that it could
affect her judgement.

Her conflict arises not only from the fact that she's not being her normal self when she's with patients. But strangely, it's from the
fact that her normal fun and loving self loves her job, but when she's in her mask, she doesn't care for it at all.

Are there alternatives?

Instead of the you-centric view, you may want consider viewing the world from the perspective of one of a multitude of selves.
Each with its own wants, needs and disposition to the world [^1].

One way to start adopting this view is to notice which set of behaviors constantly show themselves in your life and name them. For example:

- Father Self
- Critical Self.
- Professional Self
- Barista Self
- Business Owner Self
- Listener Self
- Why Don't I Have That Self
- Obsessive Self

> friend owns a coffe shop. She’s boss, barista, cashier and everything. She loves the following things. She runs into situations where she has to summon a certain mindset to make it all withwhile. She calls it the multi hat state. She’s wearing the barista hat, the professional hat, etc…

Once you've named them, then it becomes easier to notice who's in charge of your world at any given time.

A friend of mine owns a coffee shop. His passion is making perfect espressos. When he describes his day to me, he does it in terms
of selves.

### Later

- So who is really you? Here comes the disucssion of self. Meaning if it's not hte center you. Even the many yous, which one is it. The you!
- Maybe one of the benefits. Not viewing yourself, but viewing the world. This distinction will is important and will become clear later.
- Modify example paragraph with the hats analogy
- when learning self is in charge, then ego self has the least say.
- Compatible selves. If someone is behing directed purely by ego self, then which self do you need to pull out? Definitely not your ego self.
