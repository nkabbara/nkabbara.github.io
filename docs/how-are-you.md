_This is not an attempt at philosophy. It's purely subjective. The second person
in my articles is not the conventional one. Itâ€™s referring to one of the me's described here._

When you think of yourself, you probably envision yourself at the bullseye of a circle with
different parts. These parts are what make you who you are.
Usually, these are: the physical part, the emotional part, the professional part, etc...

Each of these parts will have some tasks for you to complete. And when you do, you're supposed
to feel more fulfilled. More you.

The physical part will have something like exercise three times a week, eat healthy
meals on weekdays. The emotional part might have something like meditate for thirty minutes a day,
tell the people that you love, that you love them.

This view of yourself has problems.

**First, it centers _you_ at the middle of it all.** As you workout and meditate and communicate your love
consistently over the years, it will increase the resolution of the _you_ in the center. You _become_ the fit,
contemplative, loving person.

<img src="/assets/hey-you-in-the-middle.png" height="400" style="float: right;">

The problem with that identification is that as soon as you can't do the things that you thought made you
_you_, your identity is shaken.

Not being able to work out anymore due to a chronic injury will change _you_
from fit, contemplative, loving to unfit, contemplative and loving. This blow to your identity could manifest
in detrimental ways starting from unproductive habits to depression.

**Second, it is overwhelming to be the conductor in the center running the whole show.** Everyday of every year, until you the day you die,
you have to tend to all the parts at all times under the pressure of your identity. Your center _you_.

Not tending to one of the parts feels bad. Like a ding in your identity's armor.

(maybe replace #2 with conflic resolution between parts. How can it be done if it's the same part?)

**Finally, the you-centric model does not match with how things feel in reality.** Observe yourself in the following situations:

- Hanging out with a close friend
- Hanging out with your boss
- Under extreme stress
- Alone in your living room staring at the ceiling
- Very hungry
- Making love

Do these feel like the same _you_ in the center, but with a different mood? Or the do they feel more like a **completely different person?**

How you think about things matters. If you think about them incorrectly, you'll end up spending a lot of energy
on exceptions to make things fit into your thinking. Solar system math pre Galileo was littered with many
complicated exceptions in order to justify the sun's orbit around the earth. All those exceptions became unnecessary
after his discoveries. Things naturally fell into place without the need for exceptions.

Maybe in the same way, moving away from the you-centric model, might change the wind to your advantage in how you interact with the world.

A friend, an infectologist, recently described to me a situation which encapsulates all the problems with the you-centric view.

She said that whenever she's with a patient, she feels like a fraud. She has to abandon her true self, the fun and loving person that
she knows and wear a mask. The mask hides _her_ and shows a matter-of-fact and an emotionally unconnected doctor. She can't show
her fun side because her patients are usally in very serious condtions. And she can't show her love because she said that it could
affect her judgement.

Her conflict arises not only from the fact that she's not being her normal self when she's with patients. But strangely, it's from the
fact that her normal fun and loving self loves her job, but when she's in her mask, she doesn't care for it at all.

Are there alternatives?

Instead of the you-centric view, you may want consider viewing the world from
the perspective of one of a multitude of selves. Each with its own wants,
needs and disposition to the world [^1].

One way to start experimenting with this view is to notice which set of behaviors
cohesive constantly show themselves in your life and name them. For example:

- Father Self
- Husband Self
- Professional Self
- Business Owner Self
- Obsessive Self

Once you've named them, then it becomes easier to notice who's in charge of your world
at different times.

When you're hanging out with your kids, it might be the Father Self that's occupying
the leadership position. You're nurturing, protective, loving and playful. And
when your kid accidentally punches you in the nose, your Fight-or-Flight Self takes
over and suddently, you're angry, upset and aggressive. Until the Father Self takes
over again.

In this model, there is no a center You Self. And there's no single self in charge at all times.
There are just these different selves that you've named and each is in charge at different times.
It's very dynamic.

After playing with this for a while and being able to easily tell which self is charge, you can take
things a step further and start playing with summoning the optimal self for some
situation you're in.

An aqaintance of mine is an engineer that works on projects that impact millions of users.
At times, he has to perform mission ciritlca tasks while a dozen colleagues are
watching every step he's taking. He said that these situations always start with the wrong
self in charge. It's usually the Professional Self that wants to maintain a certain image,
or the Over Cautions Self enumerating in his ear all the bad things that could happen. He said
that he has to actively take a step back and invite the Engineer Self to take the floor.
The calm, stoic and calculating self that can run the show with steady hands.

As you can see from my friend's example, naming selves and learning how to summon
them for their proper role, implies an interaction between the selves. It's a dynamic
partnership, where when one is needed, they take charge, but they're not hugnry for power.
They give up the floor when they know another self is better suited for the role.

When you're able to clearly observe the interaction between different selves and which
work well together, you may start grouping them into duos, trios or quartets of selves.
Each member of the band holds the fort when they're needed and gracefully gives it up
when the next member's abilities are more suitable to the change that is taking place.

In my friend's example, at work, he has a quartet that he calls the Work Quartet.

Its members are the Engineer Self to handle the technical tasks. When those
are done, the Professional Self takes over to handle the results of the work. The Learner
Self almost always shows up to observer what lessons can be taken from what was done and if
there's room for improvements for next time.

The last member of the Pro Quartet is the Obsessive Self. He's the one that stays up late at night trying
to solve a problem when it's well past his bedtime, and things have become unproductive for everyone.
Meaning the rest of the band is going to be sub-optimal the next day. Afterall, all the selves share the same body.

Which brings us to the fact that in the beginning, you might not get to pick all the band members.
They're just there. You can learn how to summon each for a solo, or discourage some from taking big parts.
But acceptance of each self as it is essential for this to work.

- Resolution of you, overwhelming and no match with reality

My doctor friend at the beginning of this article viewed the world from a you-centric angle. Her
You in the middle was a doctor that is supposed to behave and act in certain ways. Anytime she veered
from that, she felt like she's not herself.

With a multi-self model, she might observe a Work Trio. The Doctor Self might take the leadership
when emergiencies, analysese & prognosese are called for. The Ampethy Self could take over when a patient is
describing his pain and how his condition is disrupting his life. The Playful self might take over when
the patient is in recovery and things are looking good.

And when she gets home, her Home Trio might take over. The Pet Mother self plays with the dogs and walks them.
The Writer Self continues working on her article. And the Fitness Self focuses on the body to improve
its strength and nimbleness for the rest of her selves and bands.

There's no a centered doctor who's image drives her whole being anymore. She might not feel overhelmed
that she has to do a million things in order for things to be fine. And her view of the world matches
perfectly based on which role or situation she's in.

If this is making sense to you and you can experientially observe it, then a very curious
question comes up. **Whos is really you?**

## Miscellatnea

- The ultamate goal of each self is to increase the well being and happiness of all selves
  in the long run.
- Naming selves is mainly an exercise in creativity, but with one important rule: the name
  cannot have any negative connotations. At best, it should describe how things actually are like
  and not use an overloaded term. Examples: I Want it Too Self vs. Jealous Self. The former doesn't
  have a negative connotation, while the last could mean many things. Being gentle with each self
  is imporant for its growth. Otherwise, it'll cry for attention and try to take over the band.
- There are times when it feels like there's nothing you can do to summon a self. A
  dictator-like sub-optimal self is in control. Maybe this self is lacking something? Can you give
  them what they need and learn more about them?
- A instructive exercise is one where you pause at every liminal moment and you ask, which self is
  in charge now?
- Realize that most people are viewing the world from a you-centric lense. If the multi-selves
  view clicks for you, you'll notice that, actually, different selves are present base on the
  interaction. When you're alone with a friend he might be one way, but when your with them
  in a group, he could be 'like a completely different person'. It's a good practive to match
  one of your optimal self with the present self of the person you're with. If they're worth
  the effort.

### Later

- So who is really you? Here comes the disucssion of self. Meaning if it's not hte center you. Even the many yous, which one is it. The you!
- Maybe one of the benefits. Not viewing yourself, but viewing the world. This distinction will is important and will become clear later.
- Modify example paragraph with the hats analogy
- when learning self is in charge, then ego self has the least say.
- Compatible selves. If someone is behing directed purely by ego self, then which self do you need to pull out? Definitely not your ego self.
- Read this out loud when done. Re-edit.
- This can become detrimental if you think about it too much
