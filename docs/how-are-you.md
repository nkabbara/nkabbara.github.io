_This is not an attempt at philosophy. It's purely subjective. The second person
in my articles is not the conventional one. Itâ€™s referring to one of the me's described here_

When you think of yourself, you probably envision yourself at the bullseye of a circle with
different parts. These parts are what make you who you are (referred to as 'you' from now on).
Usually, these are: the physical part, the emotional part, the professional part, etc...

Each of those parts will have some tasks for you to complete. And when you do, you're supposed
to feel more fulfilled.

For example, the physical part will have something like exercise three times a week, eat healthy
meals on weekdays. The emotional part might have something like meditate for thirty minutes a day,
tell the people that you love, that you love them. And so on and so forth.

This view of yourself has limitations.

First, it centers 'you' at the middle of it all. As you workout and meditate and spread the love,
consistently over the years, it will increase the resolution of the 'you' in the center. You _become_ the fit,
contemplative, loving person.

The problem with that identification is that as soon as you can't do the things that you thought made you
'you', your identity is shaken. Not being able to work out anymore due to a chronic injury will change 'you'
from fit, contemplative, loving to unfit, contemplative and loving. This blow to your identity could manifest
in detrimental ways starting from minor depression, to unproductive new habits to your-mileage-may-vary.

Second, thinking about yourself as the 'you' at the center, even though conceptually, is overwhelming.
How you think about things matters. If you think about the them incorrectly, you'll end up spending a lot of energy
on workarounds and justifications.

A good analogy to this is the planetary math before Galileo's discover. Scientist pre Galileo had to come up
with complicated and convoluted math in order to make their planetary calculations work. Post Galileo the math
was simplified greatly, because his discovery represented how things really are. You didn't need justifications anymore.
