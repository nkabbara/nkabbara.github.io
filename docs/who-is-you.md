# Conventionally

You're a successfull businessman or a careerman with a good reputation. You have a solid circle of friends.
Your family loves you and you love them back in kind. You worship your god and say your prayers every night.

You exercise, do your yearly checkups and all the chores around the house without flinching. You happily
do what's needed for the task at hand without complaining.

_You_ are all those things combined.

# Not(s)

- You're not your body. Your body changes drastically every few years.
- You're not your thoughts. You change your mind more often than your body changes.
- You're not your posessions. You lose stuff and gain stuff all the time.
- You're not your religion. You may convert from Christian to Buddhist any day.
- You're not your culture. You may move to another country and build a life there.
- You're not your family. They may go live somewhere else.
- You're not your character. Experiences changes it as you carry on.
- You're not your reputation. That changes with every action you take.
- You're not your career. Your industry might be disrupted and you'll have to change careers.

What's left is _you_. **But what is left?**

# Experiencially

Think back as far as you can. What consumed you? Mostly likely objects. All you thought about were objects.

**Objects**

Now move forward a couple of decades. What consumed you? Most likely, you started to think about your own thoughts.

**Thoughts -> Objects**

Move forward again. Are you starting to think about the thinker? The one thinking those thoughts about the objects?

**Thinker -> Thoughts -> Objects**

Now, we're starting to get sophisticated. If there's a thinker that's thinking thoughts about objects and you're
observing that whole thing, then who is the observer? Who is the observer, watching the thinker think thoughts about objects?

**Observer -> Thinker -> Thoughts -> Objects**

And since you're able to again observer this whole scenario, then you're really observing the observer observing the thinker
thinking thoughts about objects.

**How many observers back can we go until we realize who is really you?**
