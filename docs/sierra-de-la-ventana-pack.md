_I couldn't get access to a scale in time before leaving, so I have no idea how much it weighed._

_Items 1 through 7 are packed in that order where Tent goes in first. This seemed like the most comfortable setup. At first I tried sleeping bag first, but that created a bottom bulge that made it very uncomfortable. I should experiment with this some more._

Some modifications I would do:
* Pack a sponge to wash stuff
* Replace hand soap with dish soap since dish soap is stronger and can be used for both.

[^1]:  On the first day, I ate breakfast at the gas station, trail mix on the trek, and 1 Ramen for dinner at camp. The next day, I had cornflakes for breakfast and trail mix on the way down to camp (I left at 9am). If I had done a hike that morning, I would have probably ate a cup of pasta or tuna or another Ramen. I overpacked a lot of food because I assumed on the first day that I would have 3 meals and on the following day as well. But the staff informed me that I should leave camp early to make it and checkout before they close to note me as "safely returned". Plan food better next time because it adds a lot of weight.
[^2]: I slept in my underwear and extra t-shirt. Didn't need pajama t-shirt.
[^3]: I should not have taken knife since I had the Morakniv anyway.
[^4]: I can read without them. Shouldn't have taken them.
[^5]: Study its features. Body was warm, but feet felt cold had to wear socks. Temp wasn't below 0 and this is 20F certified.
