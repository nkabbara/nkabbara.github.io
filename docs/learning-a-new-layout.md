## Goal

80 words per minute on ISRT layout with split staggered ortho keyboard.

## The Instructors

- Ben Vallack
- ranelpadon
- John
- [osh Kaufman](https://first20hours.com/typing/)
- Daymar

## The Plan

1. First things first. You need to learn where the keys are on the keyboard.
   For that, use (KeyZen](https://ranelpadon.github.io/keyzen-colemak-dh/)
2. You must keep from getting board. Mix-up key location learning with bigrams
   over at [Ngram Type](https://ranelpadon.github.io/ngram-type/)
3. Once you've figured out key locations, now it's time to speed things up.
   Up bigrams to trigrams in #2 then head over to [kyebr](https://www.keybr.com/).
   A program that automatically determins what words you're weak on and devizes
   lessons for you.
4. Finally, head over to MonkeyType and learn the 1000 most common words.
5. Incorporate symbols and numbers
6. At any point you reach 50 wpm (with symbols and numbers), you can make ISRT your main layout

## The mental model

Think of typing as a different set of muscle memories (motor skills) grouped together by layout.
For qwerty, you have one bag of muscle memory. For isrt, another bag of muscle memories.

Muscle memory is when you think a letter a finger moves to a certain destiantion and pushes. Take
it further, when you see a whole word, you fingers move to certain positions and come back.

## Their Common (and not so common) Advice

- When you make a mistake, delete whole word (alt-delete) instead
  of characters. And repeat. Train your brain on words.
- If you notice that you're messing up the same word over and over
  see which bigrams you're confusing and go train on those
- If you feel like your fingers are not precise and hitting neighboaring buttons
  it's probably because you're coming from querty.
- With some bigrams, you'll notice that alt-fingering is more effective. Start
  training your muscle memory with this fromt he get go. Examble 'b' might be easier
  typed by moving your hand over first column and hitting 'b' instead of streching index.
- Progress is not linear. You'll flatline for a while.
- Keep homerow as your resting place if 80WPM is your goal
- Pausing is OK is preferred over making mistakes. Pause over words you don't
  know and plan how to execute them.
- Focus on accuracy before speed. If you start with speed, then you'll train on inaccuracy.
  Bad habits are harder to get rid off. Forming good habits is easier.
- Try to think of typing the whole word with all your fingers instead of typing on character at time.
  If this is too hard, then type it in bigrams or trigrams or quadgrams or syllabals. Basically hands
  on keyboard, word is typed
- Practice before going to bed to allow muscle memory to form more easily.
- Separate practice sessions for speed and accuracy
- Some words you'll type faster than others. That's OK. Remember you need accuracy, so type
  words you know fast and once you don't know slow so you lower mistakes.
- When you notice that your mind is faster than your fingers, go back to bigrams.

## Notes

- Sometimes closing yoru eyes and visualaizing while focusing on muscle moving helps.
- Try to think of bigrams as one go and space. Pause, one go and space. So your fingers all on keyboard to type it instead of letter than another.
