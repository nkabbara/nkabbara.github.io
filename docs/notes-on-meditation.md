There are concepts in meditation that are strongly ephemeral. You get an insight during practice,
but in an instant, it could leave your mind and never return.

Here, [we're](/how-are-you.html) documenting these epiphanies.

## Finding The Meditator

A very useful insight when it comes to identity & self is that they don't truly exist.

One way to experiment with that is to meditate in a traditional fashion: focus your attention on your breath,
and as you get distracted, bring your attention back to the breath. Once you have some
stability in keeping your attention there, turn your attention back to see who is meditating. ie. Try
to find the meditator.

One common reaction to this is your mind visualizes you, as you usually perceive yourself,
turning back to look back at you. Right before the turn is over, things get confused. How can _you_ turn
back to look back at _you_ [^1]?

Another possible reaction that usually happens after you've become aware of the first one is your mind
skips that visual turn. It realizes that there's no need to imaging a turn, since there's really nothing turning.
So it looks back instantly and usually lands at nothing. Just blankness.

These reaction have an essential insight: imaging _you_ turning back to see _you_ plants the seed of realizing
that how you think of _you_ might be flawed. How can I look back to see I. Did I make copies of me to do this?

Then, staring at blankness, brings us closer to a deeper realization. It helps us realize that you, your identity
and how you imaging yourself as an entity is a visualisation of the mind. It's just a construct like
the imagined you turning back to look back at you. The blankness is a recognition that
there's nothing there to find. There is no meditator to find. There is no _you_ there as you've though about
how _you_ is.

**So what?**

One thing you can do with it is reconstruct your imagined _you_ in different ways to better match the world.
Since now you know that your mind built this _you_ and it has parts that don't seem congruent with how things really are,
you may start working on taking them out and replacing them with parts that fit better. The "re-imagine yourself" cliche is more
real than we thought.

## Shifting Your Center

For some strange reason, we tend to think of ourselves as centered somewhere behind our eyes and between
our ears. Go into meditation and focus on the breath. Now, ask yourself, where am I focusing from. The answer will
most likely be somewhere around that region.

Keeping with the meditation, thank your mind for all it has done for you and ask your awareness
to move from your mind down to your jaw. **You are
not making your awareness move, nor are you focusing from your previous center down to your jaw.** You're making a
request for awareness to be in your jaw. The feeling here is not a directional awareness from previous center to jaw,
but rather, feeling your jaw from within your jaw, as your jaw.

**This subtle shift of center is what we're after.**

You'll succeed for a bit, but as if by gravitational force, your awareness will go back up to the head region. Just repeat
the process of asking your awareness to live in your jaw again so your jaw is your new center.

One of the ways your mind might make this difficult for you is by making you believe that since the brain is where
your mind is and your mind is where thoughts happens, it follows that that's where your center should be.
Another perspective to see this from
is just as when you thought your center was in your mind and you could feel your jaw, now your center is in your
jaw, but you can feel your mind, along with the thoughts that it might be producing. So when you shift your
center and then later notice thoughts emanating from your head region, it's expected. We are not trying to exclude the mind. Just moving
center to where it should be in the current context.

This isn't limited to thoughts. It encompasses all your senses. So hearing with a center shifted to jaw means that
you're hearing from your jaw center. Not your mind center. From your mind center, you react differently to sounds
than you would from your jaw center.

As you gain more stability in shifting your center and staying there, at first, closer to the mind, then farther;
continue until you identify a place that makes you feel the most connected. Usually around the heart area. Try doing this
in your practice enough times so that it can stay with you post practice. Instead of going about your day with a mind
center, try it with a heart center.

Remember, wherever you awareness is, you're not aware of it from your head region, you are aware of it from where it is,
as it is. Your head region is just one of the things that's there and that should be acknowledged and given some of
the attention as needed. Just like when your center was in your mind, it too gave attention to other parts of your body.
It deserves the same treatment.

**So what?**

When you're listening to music, try shifting your center to your ears. When you're dancing, to your hips. When you're listening
to a friend, to your heart. When you're solving a problem, to your mind [^2]. When you're trying to sleep, to all the points of contact
your body is making with the bed. You may observe that what you do or say next, might be very different than when you had your
awareness mind centered at all times.

[^1]: If you succeed, will you see yourself looking back at you?
[^2]: The mind might have different centers as well. Think focused center and diffused center.
