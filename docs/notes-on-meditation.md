_shitty first draft_

There are concepts in meditation that are strongly ephemeral. You understand it at one point,
but if you don't practice it contantly, it falls through your fingers like sand. And finding
again might be a exercise in luck.

Here, we're documenting these concepts as an aid to memory.

## Finding The Meditator

A very useful insight when it comes to identity & self is that they don't truly exist.

One way to experiment with that is to meditate in a traditional fashion: focus yoru attention on your breath,
and as you get distracted, bring your attention back to the breath. Once you have some
stability in keeping your attention at your there, turn your it back to see who is the meditator.

When you attempt this, your mind might react in many different ways. One common reaction is your
mind visualizes you, as you usually perceive yourself, turning back to look back at you. After the
turn is over, things get confused and you're back to paying attention to the breath. Another common reaction
that usually happens after you've become aware of the first one is your mind skips that visual turn
and looks at nothing. Your minds eye stars at blankness.

This happens becuase after you've understood the implications of the first reaction: that you, your identity
and how you imaging yourself as an entitity is a visualisation of the mind. It's just a construct like
the imagined turning back to look at you looking back at you. The blankness is a recognition that
there's nothing there to find. There is no meditator to find. There is nothing.

So what?

It's up to you to come up with what you'd like to do with this discovery. **One thing is for sure,
you are not you.**

## Changing Your Center

Identifying your brain and it's capsule, your head, as the your center is very a common trick of the mind
to keep awareness focused in that region.

Instead, try this: meditate conventionally, with your awareness pointed at your breath. Now find the focuser,
where is he? You'll most likey find him in the region behind your eyes and in between your temples. You might
thing of this feeling or regions as the you.

Thank your familiar head focuser for all what it has done for you and move your awareness down to your jaw. Now,
You might feel like you are paying attention to your jaw from where you first found the focuse. That's fine, but
**now you need to be aware of your jaw from withing your jaw as your jaw.**

You'll succeed for a bit, but as if by gravitational force, your awareness will go back up to the head region. That's
totally fine. Back to the jaw, within the jaw, as the jaw. This time, it's going to be easier to notice the gravitational
pull to your head. Instead of allowing it to go up, let it be a line of communication with your head reagion.

In other words, just like when you're in your head reagion and you can feel sensations and existence of your jaw,
this time, you are in your jaw region, but you're able to feel and notice thoughts in your head region. Your center is your jaw now.

Continue dropping your awareness in the same manner with as little movements as you need so you're stable [2]. You may
reach your heart or you may reach your feet.

Remember, wherever you awareness is, you're not aware of it from your head region, you are awre of it from where it is,
as it is. Your head region is just one of the things that's there and htat should be acknowledged and given some of
the attention if needed. Jus like your head might give attention to some pain or something that is asking for it.

So what?

Once you've done this enough times, you may move your awareness as described when in the middle of certain activities
and you'll find that you'll enjoy them tremedously. For example, moving your awarenes to your ears when listenting
to good music [3]. To your hips and torso when you're learning to dnace. To your head, but intentionally and from different
points of views when you're working on somthethig cerebral.
