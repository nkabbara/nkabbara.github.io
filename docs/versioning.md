### `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` = `CHANGE-OF-MIND.CONTENT-ADDITION.STYLING-GRAMMAR-FIXES`

### Also

If an artile's version begins with 0, like 0.2.11, it means that the ideas in the article are still under experimentation.
ie. I'm convinced enough to write about them and to try them out, but I'm not sure if I'll want to in five years.

When I've successfully integrated the ideas into my thinking and happy with the results, then it'll get a 1.x.x.

### Also Also

I'm writing to myself. These articles are to help me sleep better when I can't. To learn better when I'm not.
To be happier when I'm sad. To have some answers to what does it all mean when I need them.
If they help others in any way, then I'm one thousand times happier.
