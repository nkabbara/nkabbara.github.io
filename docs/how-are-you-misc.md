# Miscellatnea

- The ultamate goal of each self is to increase the well being and happiness of all the selves
  in the long run.
- Naming selves is mainly an exercise in creativity, but with one important rule: the name
  cannot have any negative connotations. At best, it should describe how things actually are like
  and not use an overloaded term. Examples: I Want it Too Self vs. Jealous Self. The former doesn't
  have a negative connotation, while the last could mean many things. Being gentle with each self
  is imporant for its growth. Otherwise, it'll cry for attention and try to take over the band.
- There are times when it feels like there's nothing you can do to summon a self. A
  dictator-like sub-optimal self is in control. Maybe this self is lacking something? Can you give
  them what they need and learn more about them?
- A instructive exercise is one where you pause at every liminal moment and you ask, which self is
  in charge now?
- Realize that most people are viewing the world from a you-centric lense. If the multi-selves
  view clicks for you, you'll notice that, actually, different selves are present base on the
  interaction. When you're alone with a friend he might be one way, but when your with them
  in a group, he could be 'like a completely different person'. It's a good practive to match
  one of your optimal self with the present self of the person you're with. If they're worth
  the effort.
- You may notice that you're naming too many selves. I think this takes a lot of trial and error
  to feel what is a self and what is a charactaristic of a self. How do you know that you're
  naming a self and not a charactaristic of a self? I think this questions is worth exploring
  if you're adopt this kind of view.
