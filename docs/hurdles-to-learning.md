You're excited to learn a subject. And all the incentives are aligned. Still, you're going to
face challenges. It's the way of the brain. Here are some:

### False End Image (FEI)

When you start going over new material to learn something, you often start with a false end image. Say it's a book.
You picture yourself in the future, when you're done reading it, with extra abilities[^1] acquired.

But this is a false image to harbor. Because when you're done, you most likely will not have acquired those imagined abilities.
Which will result in disappointment. We don't want disappointment while learning. We want constant motivation and fun.

So we must set a proper expectation.

A better end image to harbor would be to imagine your abilities just **as they are now, but with a few changes:**

1. You will have better questions to ask.
2. Your mind will see more patterns related to what you've learned.
3. You will have a better idea about where to go next for more.

### This Should Be Easier (SBE)

A.K.A You should already know this.

Often, when you're learning a new subject, you'll encounter material that you thought you were already
good at. But when you try to apply it, you discover that that's not actually true (anymore).

The unproductive self talk would be: this should be easier or I should already know this.

The productive attitude to summon here is: **ok, another opportunity to review this material and reinforce my knowledge.**
