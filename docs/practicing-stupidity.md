You don't want to look stupid because you want others to think that you're smart [^1]. But doing so impedes your growth.

When you hesitate to ask a stupid question in order to maintain an image, you miss an opportunity to learn something new. When you avoid walking across the coffee shop to talk to the seemingly interesting person, you lose an opportunity of a good friendship. There are many varations of this and they mostly result in missed opportunities.

Why do you avoid looking stupid if being ok with it makes you smarter?

Probably because looking smart could mean more money, more respect, more power or more popularity. So you do everything you can to look smart.

Another possibility is your cultural norms in regards to stupidity and how you were raised in the context of those norms. You might have been chastised as a child for asking stupid questions or for doing seemingly stupid things[^2]. That child might be here with you now trying to avoid pain.

Here are five productive ways to think about stupidity:

1. Redefine stupidity as missing the obvious.
2. Always assume you're below average, even in your field of expertise, and work hard at becoming above average.
3. To fail or not know something is a result, not a fault.
4. It's impossible for you to learn what you've told yourself you already know.
5. Think of the feeling of stupidity as a signal alerting you that there's more to learn and explore.

Being OK with feeling stupid requires practice. Practice will hone your senses at catching the feeling of not wanting to look stupid and then acting according to your best interest instead of tending to that feeling.

In order to be in a situation where you experience the feeling of being stupid repeatedly, you must learn something hard. Then, you must perform what you're learning with people that are already proficient in the subject matter. Finally, failing over and over with these people shouldn't cause you irreversible harm.

A good example of something that meets these requirements is learning a new language. A foreign language will almost certainly be difficult to learn. You must speak it with native speakers in order to practice it and measure your progress. Constantly failing until you've improved sufficiently shouldn't cause you any harm if you're learning with the right people.

The most beneficial characteristic of this is the sheer amount of trivial mistakes that you will make as you speak with a native. Feeling stupid several times per conversation is great practice at discovering the shape of the feeling of stupidity. You'll observe its full cycle that usually begins in a contraction (see handling mistakes note) of the mind, then probably a grimmace or an annoyed facial expression, then some verbal justification then you forget most of it with some residue left in your mind.

Going through this hundreds of times in a short period of time familiarizes your mind with it enough that you know, it's not going to kill you...[wip]

you may allow it in for visits with the knowledge that it's going to leave as you concern yourself with the significance of the benefits that await its absence: growth and wisdom.

[^1]: Or to avoid the bad feeling of feeling stupid.
[^2]: Being around wise people is the best thing you could do.
