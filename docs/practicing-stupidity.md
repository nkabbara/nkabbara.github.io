Not wanting to look stupid has probably stifeled your growth and stinted your opportunities more than you mighthave noticed. It’s probably still stifling your current growth and will probably continue to do so.

Here are some common scenarios:

You’re in a meeting with smart people and you want to ask a fundamental question about the problem under discussion. But you might look stupid if you did.
You’re at a coffee shop and want to go up to the cute girl at the table across from you to talk to her. But you might look stupid if you did.
…
Since early childhood you were trained not to look stupid. So this feeling is so deeply ingrained in you that you might not be able to transmute it.

Your only defense might actually be to notice this feeling of being stupid and getting comfortable with it.

What is stupidity?

A useful definition to adopt is: missing the obvious.

This definition is useful because you will almost always miss the obvious when you’re in a situation where you lack information or knowledge.
