Not wanting to look stupid is stifling your growth.

- When you hesitate to ask a seemingly stupid question in order maintain an image, you miss an opportunity to learn something.
- The friendship you could make with someone is a looking-stupid step away from them having a conversation with you.

You don't want to look stupid because you want others to think you're smart. Looking smart could mean more money, power or popularity. So you do everything you can to not look stupid.

Add to that your cultural norms in regards to stupidity and how you were raised in the context of those norms. You might have been spanked as a child for asking stupid questions or for doing seemingly stupid things. That child might be here now with you trying to hide your stupidity.

But wise people know that stupid now means smart later [^1]. In other words, you always start stupid when the context is new, even if you're an expert at the subject at hand, but gradually, you start to get smart.

Here are some ways to think about stupidity:

- Redefine stupidity as: missing the obvious. When you're learning something new, you will miss the obvious no matter how smart you are.
- Always assume you're below average, and work hard at getting to above average.
- Think: stupid now, smart later.
- Saying I don't know when you really don't is a super power because it makes room for growth. Saying otherwise, will prevent a learning opportunity.
- It's impossible for you to learn what you've told yourself you already know.
- To fail or not know something is a result, not a fault.
- Think of the feeling of stupidity as a signal alerting you that there's more to learn and explore.

Reading this will not prepare you for being OK with feeling stupid. You need to practice it. You will hone your senses at catching the feeling of not wanting to look stupid and then acting according to your best interest instead of tending to that feeling.

Practicing being OK with feeling stupid requires the following:

1. Learning something hard.
2. People must be involved in your practice.
3. Failing over and over should not cause you any unrecoverable damage. Like physical, mental, or financial.

A good example of something that meets these requirements is learning a new language. A language that's foreign to you will be difficult to learn. You must speak it with native speakers in order to practice it and measure your progress. Constantly failing until you've improved sufficiently shouldn't cause you any harm if you're learning with the right people.

The most beneficial characteristic of this is the sheer amount of trivial mistakes that you will make as you speak with a native. Feeling stupid several times per conversation is great practice at discovering the shape of the feeling of stupidity. Once observed intimately, you may allow it in for visits with the knowledge that it's going to leave as you concern yourself with the significance of the benefits that await its absence: growth and wisdom.
