_This is for you Nash_

Not wanting to look stupid is stifling your growth.

- When you hesitate to ask a seemingly stupid question in order maintain an image, you miss an opportunity to learn something. Most likely, there are a few others around you behaving similarly. If you were to ask that question, not only would you have clarified things for you, but for others too.
- The cute girl sitting across from you at the coffee shop is a looking stupid step away from having a conversation with you.

You don't want to look stupid because you want others to think you're smart. Looking smart could mean more money, more girls and more popularity. So you do everything in your power to not look stupid. Add to that your cultural norms in regards to stupdity and how you were raised in the context of those norms. You might have been spanked as a child for asking stupid questions or doing seemingly stupid things. That child might be here now with you trying to hide your stupidity.

But truly smart people know that stupid now means smart later. In other words, you always start stupid when the context is new, even if you're an expert at the subject at hand, but gradually, you start to get smart.

Here are some ways to think about stupidity:

- Redefine stupidity as missing the obvious. When you're new to something or learning about it, you will miss the obvious no matter how smart you are.
- Always assume you're below average, and work hard at getting to above average.
- Think: stupid now, smart later.
- Saying I don't know when you really don't is a super power in progress. Saying otherwise, will prevent a learning opportunity.
- It's impossible for you to learn what you've told youself you already know.
- To fail or not know something is a result, not a fault.
- When you judge others, you do not define them; you define yourself. The same goes for others.
- Think of the feeling of stupidity as a signal alerting you that there's more to learn and explore.

Reading this will not prepare you for being ok with feeling stupid. You need to practice it. Doing so will hone your senses at catching the feeling of not wanting to look stupid and then acting according to your best interest instead of tending to the feeling.

Practicing being ok with feeling stupid requires the following:

1. Learning something hard.
2. People must be involved in your learning.
3. Failing over and over should not cause you any unrecoverable damage. Like physical, mental, or financial.

A good example of something that meets the requirements above is learning a new language. A language that's foreign to you will be difficult to learn. You must speak it with native speakers in order to practice it and measure your progress. Constantly failing until you've improved sufficiently shouldn't cause you any harm if you're learning with the right people.

WIP:

1. trying to speak the new language with a native will cause a lot of mistakes
2. These mistakes are will bring out the feeling of looking stupid with high frequency
3. This will allow you to notice the shape of that feeling: how your mind contact, how your body reacts, your facial expressions, etc...
4. Being sable to identify that clearly will help you in becoming familiar with it and accepting it.
5. Once it's accepted then you can decide how to react to it based on context.
