## Goal

80 words per minute on ISRT layout with split staggered ortho keyboard.

## The Instructors

- Ben Vallack
- ranelpadon
- John
- [osh Kaufman](https://first20hours.com/typing/)
- Daymar

## The Plan

1. First things first. You need to learn where the keys are on the keyboard.
   For that, use (KeyZen](https://ranelpadon.github.io/keyzen-colemak-dh/)
2. You must keep from getting board. Mix-up key location learning with bigrams
   over at [Ngram Type](https://ranelpadon.github.io/ngram-type/)
3. Once you've figured out key locations, now it's time to speed things up.
   Up bigrams to trigrams in #2 then head over to [kyebr](https://www.keybr.com/).
   A program that automatically determins what words you're weak on and devizes
   lessons for you.
4. Finally, head over to MonkeyType and learn the 1000 most common words.
5. Incorporate symbols and numbers
6. At any point you reach 50 wpm (with symbols and numbers), you can make ISRT your main layout

## The mental model

Think of typing as a different set of muscle memories (motor skills) grouped together by layout.
For qwerty, you have one bag of muscle memory. For isrt, another bag of muscle memories.

Muscle memory is when you think a letter a finger moves to a certain destiantion and pushes. Take
it further, when you see a whole word, you fingers move to certain positions and come back.

## Their Common (and not so common) Advice

- When you make a mistake, delete whole word (alt-delete) instead
  of characters. And repeat. Train your brain on words.
- If you notice that you're messing up the same word over and over
  see which bigrams you're confusing and go train on those
- If you feel like your fingers are not precise and hitting neighboaring buttons
  it's probably because you're coming from querty.
- With some bigrams, you'll notice that alt-fingering is more effective. Start
  training your muscle memory with this fromt he get go. Examble 'b' might be easier
  typed by moving your hand over first column and hitting 'b' instead of streching index.
- Progress is not linear. You'll flatline for a while.
- Keep homerow as your resting place if 80WPM is your goal
- Pausing is OK is preferred over making mistakes. Pause over words you don't
  know and plan how to execute them.
- Focus on accuracy before speed. If you start with speed, then you'll train on inaccuracy.
  Bad habits are harder to get rid off. Forming good habits is easier.
- Try to think of typing the whole word with all your fingers instead of typing on character at time.
  If this is too hard, then type it in bigrams or trigrams or quadgrams or syllabals. Basically hands
  on keyboard, word is typed
- Practice before going to bed to allow muscle memory to form more easily.
- Separate practice sessions for speed and accuracy
- Some words you'll type faster than others. That's OK. Remember you need accuracy, so type
  words you know fast and once you don't know slow so you lower mistakes.
- When you notice that your mind is faster than your fingers, go back to bigrams.

## Notes & Questions

- Sometimes closing yoru eyes and visualaizing while focusing on muscle moving helps.
- Try to think of bigrams as one go and space. Pause, one go and space. So your fingers all on keyboard to type it instead of letter than another.
- This keyboard is a starting point. So is ISRT. So modifications are going to take place. The question is, when should they be done? Now
  or later? Let's aim for 40WPM for normal words. When we're there, we can make mods (2021/12/22).
- One of you holds you back by wanting to know where the letter is. Another one knows it without knowing it. Work with both
  so a compromise that's productive for all of us is reached. Maybe when we're typing we should give more control to the one that
  knows while outside of typing learn where the letters are by writing them or drawing them?

## Practice Log

### [x] Stage 1 - Learn Key Locations with 96% accuracy

### [ ] Stage 2 - Use MonkeyType, Keybr & Ngrams. Decide goal as you go through it.

#### Internal Talk

- Allow everything to help (visual, etc..), but remember, muscle memory is key.
- Loud voice OK? Test
- Try to do letter from memory before typing. If no go, look at keymap & actively and slowly use muscle/finger to type it. Until memory works
- Memory tricks seem to help like JB (Juan Bablo) for the bottom row outer keys

### 2022/01/16 - 01

monkeytype: 19wpm passed!
keybre: letter u still @ green

### 2022/01/15 - 01

Monkeytype: 18wpm passed!
keybre: letter U! 30wpm

### 2022/01/13 - 01

mokey type: 18wpm!
keybr: letter A. 35wpm.

notes:

- When pausing in front of a word, visualize how you'll type the first couple of letters before you actually start it. Some words just comes to, but others you might need to pause longer.

### 2022/01/12 - 01

monkey type: 17wpm!
keybr: At letter A. Getting green. Speed: 34.2 (↑+8.8) Errors: 2 (↑-4.24) Score: 1283 (↑+853.6)

notes:

- When you get sick of monketype swtich to keybr :). Repeat. You found this to be helpful.

### 2022/01/10 - 01

monkey type: You got 18wpm on a repeated test
keybr: Letter A Speed: 28.6 (↑+3.34) Errors: 4 (↑-2.29) Score: 602 (↑+181.9)

notes:

- Tired. Time your practice.

### 2022/01/09 - 01

monkey type: 15wpm
keybr: Current letter a. Speed: 30.8 (↑+5.61) Errors: 5 (↑-1.26) Score: 554 (↑+133.6)

Notes:

- When repeating a failed test on monkye type, you feel like you're wasting time because it's not recorded. Adopt the following attitude instead: you want to finish it as or above your current WPM max if possible. That's the motivation. Not recording it. Remember the archer.

- When at pause before reading word, don't overstress it by overpausing there, keep a relaxed mind, but try to visualize how you'd type only the first few keys. The rest should follow.

### 2022/01/07

monkeytype: got to 16wpm today.
keybr:

notes:

- confirmed reading word before typing it is more effective than reading several ahead like before.
- When some letter locations are not clear, pause and think about your drawings so your brain can logically assign them a spacial location. Sometimes you keep forcing the typing, but it makes more sense to pause and visualize a few times then continue. It helps reduce thos mistypes.

### 2022/01/06

monkey type: finished 13wpm.
keybr: progressed to letter a!

notes:

- Actually pausing in front of a word seems more effective as far as accuracy then reading a few words ahead. Scratch note below about
  reading a few words ahead.
- Found a good mnemonic for r/e situation. R is on the left and E is on the right because REpeat. Als RE: . MAke sense for r to be on the left and
  e on the right. You just tested this with keybr and seems to have worked. You progressed to two new letters.

### 2022/01/05

keybr: Speed: 35.2 (↑+10.94) Errors: 2 (↑-4.56) Score: 1002 (↑+638.7)
monkey type: couldn't finish a test today

### 2022/01/04

monkeytype: seems like 4 minutes is a good time. Getting 13WPM right now.
kebr: doing good.

note:
noticed on keybr that theh er re mistypes happen on bigrams where e follows or r follows e. Work on practicing these specifically.

### 2022/01/03

keybr: Speed: 44.2 (↑+21.74) Errors: 6 (↑-0.49) Score: 544 (↑+200.3)
monkeytype: Couldn't finish 5 minutes. And very tired.

### 2022/01/02

monkey type (finish two five-minute tests): You finished one, but had timer at 10m. You just updated it to 5 minutes.
keybr:

### 2022/01/02 (past midnight)

keybr: Speed: 28.4 (↑+8.45) Errors: 3 (↑-3.94) Score: 601 (↑+333.1). About 20 minutes.
monkey type: about 16 minutes

note:

- you are having issues confusing r with e. You noticed that if you stopped and visualized the symbol for row 3
  (lrw) fish-hook, and then everytime you're about to hit the r, you visualized the fishhook and where the r is on it,
  you made less mistakes. As for e, it's on the right side, so the end-side. e for end.

  Point is, visualizing symbols for difficult chars seems to help your muscle memory

### 2022/01/01

today Monkeytype & keybr. Making good progress

### 2021/12/30

Monketype: 9WPM @ 96accuracy
keybr: Speed: 19.6 (↑+2.51) Errors: 1 (↑-6.48) Score: 830 (↑+621.6)
notes:
Found good progress when reading a few words ahead. It's like the brain subconciously prepares for them.
Keep experimenting with this: read a few words and type, when you're get close to the end repeat

notes:

- Trying the following today:

  - MonkeyType 25 minutes
  - Keybr 20 minutes
  - On next run, do MonkeyType & ngrams. Try this kind of rotation

  Reason is you don't want to just do ngrams and homerow stuff and end up not being productive in whole words.

- Typing in bigrams doesn't seem effective. It seems like in whole word is better and let bigrams kick in if they're there.

notes:

- read the word before typing it.
- Some words you'll type faster, some slower. Do the fast one fast and the slow ones without mistakes.
- Include hard session in your daily practice. Or you'll just be good at the easy stuff. Maybe monkye type then jump back to keybr?
  From reddit:

> 94% is a bit too low and it's likely hinders your progress. Slow down and set the minimum accuracy to 96%. If a test fails, then don't skip to the next test, but repeat the test again. This is important because otherwise you are a "test skipper", who skips practicing weaknesses and not gonna fix them. After a successful test (with <100% accuracy) do the "missed words" test, this way you further practice your weaknesses. If you want to improve, then don't rush for speed, focus on weaknesses and increase your accuracy, speed follows automatically

### 2021/12/24

keybr: Speed: 21.6 (↑+6.22) Errors: 5 (↑-1.98) Score: 302 (↑+108.5)
ngram (trigrams): Raw WPM: 13 Accuracy: 87 % Average WPM: 22
notes:

- for trigrams no strategy yet.
- instead of typing one char at at time, you're trying to type in bigrams. It's slower
  and you're mkaing more errors, but it feels like there's an upside that could come with time.
  Keep trying with this:
  - When reading the word to type, attempt to type it in bigrams.
  - Don't try to pre-break it down itno bigrams and type them, instead flow iwht the word.
  - You noticed that you tend to hit space at the end of a bigram when you type it. I think your brain
    things it's the end of the word because of the pause. Look at space as part of the bigram like char
    and just pause there if you need to. Typing space allows for a pause, a pause doesn't invoke a space.
  - For some reason your brain keeps thinking that e is on the left or that r is on the right. Could it be because
    r is the first letter of right? or because your right had wants to type r for right?
    Think r as isRt. E as end side.

Notes:

- Visualizing keyboard different. With drawings. Only did left half.
  I wonder how it will affect perfromance.
- Also, divided keybiard into 4 columns from pinky on. Outer row out
- Tried hard to get 96 in keyzen and you're sure you were hitting that, but for
  some reason it wasn't updating.
- Relaxing Keyzen since now you know key locations. Move to bigrams & [kyebr](https://www.keybr.com/).
