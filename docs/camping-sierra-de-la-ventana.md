I went on my first solo camping trip in Argentina to the Sierra de La Ventana mountain range[^1]. Looking back at the experience, it felt like I stepped out of Buenos Aires to land in a West World scene. After a three hour walk through farmland and up a pined mountain slope, the landscape instantly switches from flat and green to dramatic rocky formations with rugged peaks. It was awe inspiring mainly due to this dramatic shift.

I'm currently reading [Wilderness Navigation](https://www.amazon.com/Wilderness-Navigation-Finding-Altimeter-Mountaineers/dp/1594859450) to pickup orientation and navigation skills because I want to go back there and explore the less visited caves and grottoes that I spotted during my hikes.

Notes for next trip:
* My [pack](sierra-de-la-ventana-pack) weight kicked my butt during my 5 hour hike to my destination. I need to figure out ways to lighten it up. Food items seem to be the heaviest. Look into high calorie to weight ratio foods.
* I realized that I don't know how to properly tie guy lines to stakes. I faked it, but I want to learn a bit of knotcraft to cover the basics.
* Stay a minimum of two nights camping.
* Pack a sponge to wash stuff
* Replace hand soap with dish soap
* Water is scarce there during the summer. I used my filter, but didn't have time to boil it due to pot size and the time it would take to do so. I would like to be able to prep water a day in advance for the following day. Explore options.
