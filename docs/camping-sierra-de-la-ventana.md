I went on my first solo camping trip in Argentina to the Sierra de La Ventana mountain range[^1]. Looking back at the experience, it felt like I stepped out of Buenos Aires to land in a West World like location. After a three hour walk through farmland and up a pined mountain slope, the landscamp instantly switched from flat and green to dramatic rocky formations with rugged peaks. It was awe inspiring mainly due to this dramatic shift.

I'm currently reading []() to pickup orientation and navigation because I want to go back there and explore the less visisted caves and grottoes that I spotted during my hikes.
