## Summary

## Notes

Let's get true out of the way. What does it be to be true? Any creature or machine could observe it and agree that what they're seeing is in a certain way. Even democrats and republicans could agree on it.

Notice that “not true” does not mean false! It just means not necessarily, objectively, absolutely true for everyone, everywhere, always. It doesn’t mean you’re wrong. It means there could be another possibility or perspective.

choosing a perspective that’s useful to you right now, whether or not it’s universally true.



People speak as if they’re stating facts. They say things like “You can’t do that” and “Here’s what women want”. But it’s just their current perspective. It’s their metaphorical time zone, which is probably different from yours.


They’re not wrong. It’s just not the only answer.

A kid says a cat is a pet. A mouse says a cat is a threat. They can’t see it any other way. Their friends agree, which solidifies their view, making it feel totally true.


“From my limited point of view, based only on what I’ve experienced…” But they don’t need to say that.  Instead, we need to know that, and hear it that way.

People find facts to support their argument on any debatable topic or view of the world. Facts can be true, while the perspective is not.
