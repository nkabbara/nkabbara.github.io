## Summary

## Notes

What does it be to be true? Any creature or machine could observe it and agree that what they're seeing is true. Objectively true. 0 doubt. Even democrats and republicans could agree on it.

So 'not true' is not necessarily false or wrong. It's just saying that this is one option of the possibilities or perspectives. It's saying that the paragraph above does not apply.

So what? Well, this is a powerful notion because now you may assume a point of view that you know is not objectively and absolutely true, but you also know that it is not false or wrong. It's just the option that serves you best right now.

> People speak as if they’re stating facts. They say things like “You can’t do that” and “Here’s what women want”. But it’s just their current perspective. It’s their metaphorical time zone, which is probably different from yours.

> They’re not wrong. It’s just not the only answer.

> A kid says a cat is a pet. A mouse says a cat is a threat. They can’t see it any other way. Their friends agree, which solidifies their view, making it feel totally true.

**We need to hear almost all statements spoken to us preambled with: From my limited point of view, based only on what I’ve experienced…**

This is a good practice when hanging out with friends and they throw "facts" at us:

- She's the sweetest human in the world.
- This is the best teacher you'll ever have the privilege of learning from.
- He's a terrible dancer, I'm never dancing with him again.
- I have no other option, but to keep grinding along until I reach 'x'

When you're listening to something, most of the time it's [not the whole picture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blind_men_and_an_elephant). It's just one window through which you can see one particular view.

Someone could show you a picture of a smiling group of folks and tell you that they're happy people. Or they could show you a picture of the same group frowning and tell you they're miserable people. Which one is true? The picture only tell you that these folks were smiling at one point and frowning at another. The person showing you the picture to prove his perspective is using facts to support his argument. The picture is true, but his argument is not. It's debatable.

The point is, we can find facts to support any 'not true' point of view that we have, not matter how crazy it sounds.

Notice the word “commune” in “communicate”: we communicate mostly for social and emotional reasons, i.e to be liked. And we don't communicate facts, we communicate perspectives and tastes. To get the other to nod in agreement or to think that we're smart or interesting or not boring.

The reverse is also true. When someone communicates with us, they're after the same thing. And if you agree with them, they perceive you as taking a step into their sphere of reality solidifying it for them. We're on their side.

Bonding is one of the most heartwarming experiences. So we all have an incentive to share perspectives, in order to try and bond.

Since we can't bond over facts (they're universally and subjectively true), we use 'not true' perspectives to bond.

Why can't we bond over facts:

- her: oh look, he did the dance move called a sacada (fact).
  - him: yes.
- her: oh wow, I love his sacada, how natural it looks (perspective).
  - him: I agree, he makes it look so easy and beautiful.

In other words, almost everything everyone is telling you is not true. It's useful to them. They think it's useful to them. It might not be. We sometimes don't know what's best for us.

Feelings matter. To address them, we have to distinguish them. Get the dry facts, with no interpretation. What’s left are the feelings and meanings.

My brothers and I always accuse our mom of abandoning us when we were young. Half jokingly. That's how we feel since our grandparents did the hard work of watching after us. Our mom was almost never there and when she was she had a bad mood.

We're saying that we felt abandoned regardless of the facts. We're saying that we had an expectation that our mom should have been more present and more loving and that that expectation was not met.

This tells you more about us and what we think our needs are and nothing about my mom.

Her response to us? I was out trying to make a living for all four of us and pay your tuition since your dad was not there and was not helping.

Someone hearing my story of abandonment will look down at my mom. Someone hearing her story of struggle will look up to her.

Feelings are important, but we need to be able to separate the emotion from the dry facts. What's left after the dry facts are taken out are the perspectives and meanings.

When someone is speaking to us, they are usually doing it through two channels, an emotional channel and a factual channel. We need to listen for both.

Thinking of rules as fact will do you a disservice. They're created by us to set the shape of the game. A lot of times, they're agreed upon around lunch time when everyone just wants to leave. Other times, they're created as a knee jerk reaction to some bad event.

> Rules can be ignored. Breaking a rule can be rational and moral, if you understand the rule’s purpose, and no one is harmed.

Always be negotiating rules, especially if they're codified, especially if the other person thinks they're the bible. Think of them as the starting point to what someone thought was a good idea x years ago while in some mood or mindset.

Obligations follow the same spirit of rules, but they're more cultural: You must take care of your aging parents (why didn't they plan for their retirement?). You must always open the car door to your girlfriend (am I less of a gentleman if I don't?). You should always return someone's invite (isn't that the opposite of true giving?). As a man, you should always pay the bill (isn't this an outdated notion before women worked?).

As I'm writing those, I'm viscerally reacting to them because they're imprinted in my psyche yet I know they're not true. There are perspective that certain cultures imprinted in me. And I know this because I've lived in several cultures and each of these behaviors gets a different kind of reaction. From expectation to surprise.

> They might say you’re a bad person for not doing what they want you to do. But that’s not true. **Maybe they’re just disappointed that you’re not taking their wish as your command**.

What people are really saying when they invoke obligation: I don't want to risk hurting my ego and say "I want you to..." and then you refusing it. I'll invoke obligation or a higher power: "you must...". They're manipulating you to do something they want, but using a higher power. It's easier for them to do so.

Rules are clearly benefiting the creator of the rule, but obligations are trickier. You need to ask whose problem complying with the obligation solves and you'll know what you need to know to decide if you should comply.

Have you experienced a "don't worry about it!" when you didn't meet an obligation? It's because the person didn't care about the problem enough to manipulate you into complying with it.

Cultural meanings affect rules and obligations, which are all mostly not-true. What's polite here is impolite there. Listen carefully when someone says things similar to:

- don't make a sound when eating your soup
- don't ask someone to dance without a cabaceo
- don't chew gum in public
- don't say please and thank you to family members at dinner table.

An annoying girl crying at the park ruining your relaxation time. You are full of anger assuming that she's spoiled and one of her wants is not being. Then you learn that she fell from a tree and broke her wrist. You are full of sympathy and love for her. Same situation, different motives. _The nature of the rain is the same, but it makes thorns grow in the marshes and flowers in the gardens._

Understanding incentives and motives helps you understand the person and change how you feel about them. It helps understand why they're holding a not-true purpose as their driving force. Once their incentive changes, so will their actions. So the person and the actions are not the same. It's a temporary state that they're in until motives change.

If you want to know how a person will most likely behave towards you, try and get a good sense of how they act. Not what they say or what you think their motives are.

But their actions are the only true facts. It's what's currently happening whether it changes in the future or not. Their incentives that might change are not known even to them sometimes. And if they are know to them, they could have invented them to have a purpose. Non-truths.

Remember the split brain experiments: who asked you to walk? Why did you close the window? The brain invented those reasons whereas the facts are different. The brain invents explanations.

> Think of the implications: major life choices, attraction, excitement, love, jealousy, revenge, anxiety, fear, and interpersonal conflict. All of these are supported and defended by explanations that aren’t true.

Remember the space shuttle explosion experiment when the professor asked his students to remember what they were doing. No one remembered correctly. Not a one. So all our memories are incorrect. People will state their memories as fact, but you should know that they are not.

Do you notice how a little anger a few months or years ago could morph into hate in the present? The past is memories, that we've established are not true above, but fueled with more imagination and non-truths over to time and now it's a giant ball of anger. Not true anger is making you miserable. Because you think it's fact.

Memories and past are mostly not true.

How about the future. It's predictions. Probably based on some not-true past. Even if you're feeling tire now and thinking that you need to relax to recover is not a guarantee. Maybe relaxing is not the answer. Even if it feels 100% real.

It's always a probability when thinking about the future. Always ask, how much am I willing to bet on this from $100 to $10,000. It's almost never $10,000, which will give room for other possibilities.

You think science is true? Think again. It's just better versions of past **proposals**. Every discovery is a proposal that is expected to be improved by others. It's giant shoulders all the way down.

> The most accurate theory is not always the most useful. And a rule of thumb can be far from true, but good enough to get you where you need to go.

It feels like almost nothing is true or can't be known absolutely. Shit. Should I give up and stay in my room? An alternative is to ask, what am I going to do about it if it's true? How about if it's false? OK, now which one of those would serve me better? Then do it. But if the answer is I'm doing nothing about it, then forget it.

> That’s what this part of the book was about. Distrust limitations. Strip away interpretations to see the few actual facts. We’re held back not by raw facts, but by the meanings we give them.

I, Nash,

- Almost nothing I say is true.
- I focus on one angle of the whole picture.
- My brain makes up explanations.
- My perspective feels like a fact.
- My certain future is just a prediction.
- My thoughts are theories, open for improvement.

What incentives made my beliefs useful?
