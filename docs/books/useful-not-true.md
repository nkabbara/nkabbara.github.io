## Summary

## Notes

What does it be to be true? Any creature or machine could observe it and agree that what they're seeing is true. Objectively true. 0 doubt. Even democrats and republicans could agree on it.

So 'not true' is not necessarily false or wrong. It's just saying that this is one option of the possibilities or perspectives. It's saying that the paragraph above does not apply.

So what? Well, this is a powerful notion because now you may assume a point of view that you know is not objectively and absolutely true, but you also know that it is not false or wrong. It's just the option that serves you best right now.

> People speak as if they’re stating facts. They say things like “You can’t do that” and “Here’s what women want”. But it’s just their current perspective. It’s their metaphorical time zone, which is probably different from yours.

> They’re not wrong. It’s just not the only answer.

> A kid says a cat is a pet. A mouse says a cat is a threat. They can’t see it any other way. Their friends agree, which solidifies their view, making it feel totally true.

**We need to hear almost all statements spoken to us preambled with: From my limited point of view, based only on what I’ve experienced…**

This is a good practice when hanging out with friends and they throw "facts" at us:
 * She's the sweetest human in the world.
 * This is the best teacher you'll ever have the privilege of learning from.
 * He's a terrible dancer, I'm never dancing with him again.
 * I have no other option, but to keep grinding along until I reach 'x'

When you're listening to something, most of the time it's [not the whole picture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blind_men_and_an_elephant). It's just one window through which you can see one particular view.

Someone could show you a picture of a smiling group of folks and tell you that they're happy people. Or they could show you a picture of the same group frowning and tell you they're miserable people. Which one is true? The picture only tell you that these folks were smilring at one point and frowning at another. The person showing you the picture to prove his perspective is using facts to support his argument. The picture is true, but his argument is not. It's debatable.

The point is, we can find facts to support any 'not true' point of view that we have, not matter how crazy it sounds.

Notice the word “commune” in “communicate”: we communicate mostly for social and emotional reasons, i.e to be liked. And we don't communicate facts, we communicate perspectives and tastes. To get the other to nod in agreement or to think that we're smart or interseting or not boring.

The reverse is also true. When someone communicates with us, they're after the same thing. And if you agree with them, they perceive you as taking a step into their sphere of reality solidifying it for them. We're on their side.

Bonding is one of the most heartwarming experiences. So we all have an incentive to share perspectives, in order to try and bond.

Since we can't bond over facts (they're universally and subjectively true), we use 'not true' perpectives to bond.

Why can't we bond over facts:
* her: oh look, he did the dance move called a sacada (fact).
  *  him: yes.
* her: oh wow, I love his sacada, how natural it looks (perspective).
  * him: I agree, he makes it look so easy and beautiful.

In other words, almost everything everyone is telling you is not true. It's useful to them.

So he’s really saying that he felt abandoned. It helps both of you distinguish between the facts and the feelings.

But the person judging is usually just expressing their unmet expectations. So the statement tells you more about the accuser, and almost nothing about the accused.


Feelings matter. To address them, we have to distinguish them. Get the dry facts, with no interpretation. What’s left are the feelings and meanings.

My brothers and I always accuse our mom of abandoning us when we were young. Half jokingly. That's how we feel since our grandparents did the hard work of watching after us. Our mom was almost never there and when she was she had a bad mood.

We're saying that we felt abondoned regardless of the facts. We're saying that we had an expectation that our mom should have been more present and more loving and that that expectation was not met.

This tells you more about us and what we think our needs are and nothing about my mom.

Her response to us? I was out trying to make a living for all four of us and pay your tuition since your dad was not there and was not helping.

Someone hearing my story of abandonment will look down at my mom. Someone hearing her story of struggle will look up to her.

Feelings are important, but we need to be able to separate the emotion from the dry facts. What's left after the dry facts are taken out are the perspectives and meanings.

When someone is speaking to us, they are usually doing it through two channels, an emotional channel and a factual channel. We need to listen for both.

Thinking of rules as fact will do you a disservice. They're created by us to set the shape of the game. A lot of times, they're agreed upon around lunch time when everyone just wants to leave. Other times, they're created as a knee jerk reaction to some bad event.

> Rules can be ignored. Breaking a rule can be rational and moral, if you understand the rule’s purpose, and no one is harmed.

Always be negotiating rules, especially if they're codified, especially if the other person thinks they're the bible. Think of them as the starting point to what someone thought was a good idea x years ago.

Obligations follow the same spirit of rules, but they're more cultural: You must take care of your aging parents (why didn't they plan for their retirement?). You must always open the car door to your girlfriend (am I less of a gentlerman if I don't?). You should always return someone's invite (isn't that the opposite of giving?). As a man, you should always pay the bill (isn't this an outdated notion before women worked?).

As I'm writing those, I'm vicerally reacting to them because they're imprinted in my psychy yet I know they're not true. They're perspecitves that certain cultures imprinted in me. And I know this because I've lived in several culture and each of these gets a different kind of reaction. From expectation to surprise.

> They might say you’re a bad person for not doing what they want you to do. But that’s not true. Maybe they’re just disappointed that you’re not taking their wish as your command.

What people are really saying when they invoke obligation: I don't want to risk hurting my ego and say "I want you to..." and then you refusing it. I'll invoke obligation or a higher power: "you must...". They're manipulating you to do something they want, but using a higher power.

Rules are clearly benefiting the creator of the rule, but obligations are trickier. You need to ask whose problem complying with the obligation solves and you'll know what you need to know to decide if you should comply.

Have you experienced a "don't worry about it!" when you didn't meet an obligation? It's because the person didn't care about the problem enough to manipulate you into complying with it.

Cultural meanings affect rules and obligations, which are all not-true. What's polie here is impolite there. Listen carefully when someone says things similar to:
* don't make a sound when eating your soup
* don't ask someone to dance without a cabaceo
* don't chew gum in public
* don't say please and thank you to family members at dinner table.
