# Summary

WIP: still formulating my summary and transfering my notes. I read this book many years ago, but after going through my highlights, I realized that it deserves a fresh read. The way I read books changed a lot after reading it the first time, but I completely forgot that it's the reason for that.

# My Processed Notes To Be Categorized
(put as a note on one of the entries) Francis Bacon once remarked that “some books are to be tasted, others to be swallowed, and some few to be chewed and digested.” Reading a book analytically is chewing and digesting it.

During analytical reading, your notes will be mostly about author's concepts and yours. They're conceptual notes.

During syntopical reading, your notes will be mostly about many authors' concepts and the shape the discussion (unbeknownst to them). These are dialectical notes.

Eeach of inspectional, analytical and syntopical reading are complex acts. You must master each step of each level before attempting to do them as a whole. For example, first master how to find keywords separately from how to find key sentences, from how to find arguments. This will take time as you'll have to read each section multiple times. But as you do that over and over, you'll start noticing that in one read, you're able to ids all three in one reading. You'll also be able to combine stages together, not just steps of a stage. See note below about learning complex tasks.



# Basic Rules of Reading
* Most books should only be read inspectionally. Analytical and syntopical reading only apply to books that are over your head[^1] and worth reading.
* Every page and passage in a book should be read no more slowly than it deserves, and no more quickly than you can read it with satisfaction and comprehension. Applies to inspectional[^2], analytical and syntopical reading.
* A demanding reader is one who has formed the habit of asking the four basic questions and knows how to answer them precisely and accurrately.

[^1]: you must distinguish between a bad book and one that is over your head. They're both hard to read.
[^2]: you'll naturally be faster than in analytical here, because you keep going even if you didn't understand much at a slower rate of reading.

# Levels of Reading
1. Elementary
2. Inspectional
    1. Part 1: Inspect
    2. Part 2: Skim
3. Analytical
4. Syntopical

# The Four Basic Questions

The goal of reading actively for inspectional, analytical and syntopical reading is to constaly ask and try to answer the following four quetions:

1. WHAT IS THE BOOK ABOUT AS A WHOLE? You must try to discover the leading theme of the book, and how the author develops this theme in an orderly way by subdividing it into its essential subordinate themes or topics.
2. WHAT IS BEING SAID IN DETAIL, AND HOW? You must try to discover the main ideas, assertions, and arguments that constitute the author’s particular message.
3. IS THE BOOK TRUE, IN WHOLE OR PART? After you've answered 1 & 2, you must decide if you agree or disagree or are agnostic. Don't take the author's argument as true. Make up your own mind.
4. SO WHAT? How does this affect my way of thinking of my way of living? Has my perspective shifted? Will I behave differently? Do I need to read more on the subject?

The last two questions are the most significant and our work in the first two is to find their answers.

# Inspectional Reading

Many quite good readers, are unaware of the value of inspectional reading. They start a book on page one and plow steadily through it, without even reading the table of contents. They are thus faced with the task of achieving a superficial knowledge of the book at the same time that they are trying to understand it. That compounds the difficulty.

1. Inspectional Reading Part I: Systematic Skimming
2. Inspectional Reading Part II: Superficial Reading

Part I, skimming, prepares us to to tackle the first stage of analytical reading: comprehension of the book's structure. Whereas, Part II, superficial reading, prepares us for the second stage of analytical reading, namely interpretation of the book's content. We cannot interpret a book's content well unless we have read it a first time.

The two parts could be done simultaneously by the skilled reader, but until you become a skilled inspectional reader, do them as separate tasks.

Inspectional reading is active (you're not leaning on a wall flipping through a book): as you read, you're always looking to answer the four basic questions all active readers must answer. Constantly keep asking with the purpose of tring to find the answers.

Although you wont't have time to take extensive notes in inspectional reading, when you start getting answers to the following questions, you should note them anyway for when you come back to the book for an analytical read whether in a week or in months[^3].
1. What kind of book is it?
2. What is it about as a whole?
3. What is the structural order of the work whereby the author develops his conception or understanding of that general subject matter?

[^3]: See Inspection/Structural notes section.

## Stage I: Systematic Skimming

After this reading, you may decide that the book is not worth Part II (Superficial Reading) and put it away. You will at least have known what kind of book it is and what the author's main contention is.

Assume the following attitude before you begin part I: Think of yourself as a detective looking for clues to a book’s general theme or idea, alert for anything that will make it clearer.

Steps to complete Part I:

1. LOOK AT THE TITLE PAGE AND, IF THE BOOK HAS ONE, AT ITS PREFACE. Read each quickly. Get a feel for what the angle the author is taking and what his aim is. Categorize the book in your head with similar books you've read.
2. STUDY THE TABLE OF CONTENTS to obtain a general sense of the book’s structure; use it as you would a road map before taking a trip. It'll give a sense of how the author is planning to address his main contention.
3. CHECK THE INDEX look for topics, works and authors that are referenced many times and read some of those passages, they may contain the crux of the author's argument.
4. READ THE PUBLISHER’S BLURB. Many times it summarizes and lists the author's main points in the book. 1-4 are pre-skimming: you may now decide to not read the book, or read it later or continue with skimming proper.
5. LOOK NOW AT THE CHAPTERS THAT SEEM TO BE PIVOTAL TO ITS ARGUMENT. Read their opening and closing paragraphs, espcially the summary kinds. Your still vague understanding of the book should be gaining some resolution.
6. Finally, TURN THE PAGES, DIPPING IN HERE AND THERE, READING A PARAGRAPH OR TWO, SOMETIMES SEVERAL PAGES IN SEQUENCE, NEVER MORE THAN THAT. Only do this at the important paragraphs to get a pulse for the book. For sure, read the last few pages of the main part of the book (not epilogue). It'll most likely contain a summary of the whole book. You might need to go this far to classify some books that are hard to classify.


Outcomes:
1. You stopped at step 4 and decided to stop reading.
2. You complete Part I and decided to stop reading.
3. You completed Part I and decide it's worth a superficial reading.

In all cases, you know what kind of book it is and you know what its main arguments are.

## Stage II: Superficial Reading

One rule only: In tackling a difficult book for the first time, read it through without ever stopping to look up or ponder the things you do not understand right away. You will have a much better chance of understanding it on a second reading, but that requires you to have read the book through at least once. This is the definition of superficial reading.

We are incorrectly trained to pay the most attention to things that we don't understand. If we use this habit in superficial reading, then we will miss the forest for the trees. We will not get very far in our reading. And most importantly:
  * We won't be reading well on any level. Nether superficial nor analytical.
  * We will miss out the chance of reading the whole book and at least benefiting from the what we DO understand.

_Remember how we read Smith's The Wealth of Nations. We underlined, looked things up, and were never able to complete it. We put it aside. If we had known how to read superficially, we would have completed it and benefitted much more from it._

Note: this does not mean read quickly and uncomprehensibly. No, it's an activity with a goal of answering the four basic questions.


# Analytical Reading

You cannot begin this type of reading unless you've already completed an inspectional reading. Question: is there a skill level that would actually allow for merging the two types into one reading?

## Stage I:  Rules for finding what a book is about

1. Classify the book according to kind and subject matter.
2. State what the whole book is about with the utmost brevity.
3. Enumerate its major parts in their order and relation, and outline these parts as you have outlined the whole.
4. Define the problem or problems the author has tried to solve.

* These rules will help you answer the first basic question. _See 4 basic questions section_. Though your answer will improve in accuracy as you proceed to apply the other rules and to answer the other questions from the next stages of analytical reading.
* The inspectional reading you've done before will help you apply these rules.
* Their aim is to provide the reader who applies them with a knowledge of a book’s structure.
* You should not take the term “stage” in a chronological sense, **unless perhaps at the very beginning of your exercise as an analytical reader**[^7]. That is, it is not necessary to read a book through in order to apply the first four rules, then to read it again and again in order to apply the other rules. The practiced reader accomplishes all of these stages at once.

[^7]: See learning under insights section. At first, you maybe to to reread and apply different sections, but that should stop as  you get more skilled.

### Classifying the Book

You must know what kind of book you are reading, and you should know this as early in the process as possible, preferably before you begin to read. This is because the types of questions you ask of different kinds of books and the way you answer them is different. A book on physics is approached differently than a book on morals. We have to modify the basic questions and how you answer them for each.

Also books differ in the kinds of knowledge they have to communicate, they proceed to instruct us differently; and, if we are to follow them, we must learn to read each kind in an appropriate manner.

How do you do so? By applying the rules in inspectional reading part I.

### What the Whole Book is About

State the unity of the whole book in a single sentence, or at most a few sentences. Basically the theme or the main point.

There is only one way to know that you have succeeded. You must be able to tell yourself or anybody else what the unity is, and in a few words. (If it requires too many words, you have not seen the unity but a multiplicity.) Do not be satisfied with “feeling the unity” that you cannot express. The reader who says, “I know what it is, but I just can’t say it,” probably does not even fool himself.

How do you do so? By applying the rules in inspectional reading part II.

Note: even if the author gives you the unity of his work, don't stop there. You'll have your own version of it when you're done.

Examples of Unity:

Aristotle's unity of Odyssey:

A certain man is absent from home for many years; he is jealously watched by Poseidon, and left desolate. Meanwhile his home is in a wretched plight; suitors are wasting his substance and plotting against his son. At length, tempest-tossed, he himself arrives; he makes certain persons acquainted with him; he attacks the suitors with his own hand, and is himself preserved while he destroys them.

Unity of Tom Jones:

Boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy gets girl. [^6]

The unity of Aristotle’s Ethics:

This is an inquiry into the nature of human happiness and an analysis of the conditions under which happiness may be gained or lost, with an indication of what men must do in their conduct and thinking in order to become happy or to avoid unhappiness, the principal emphasis being placed on the cultivation of the virtues, both moral and intellectual, although other goods are also recognized as necessary for happiness, such as wealth, health, friends, and a just society in which to live.

The The Wealth of Nations:

This is an inquiry into the source of national wealth in any economy that is built on a division of labor, considering the relation of the wages paid labor, the profits returned to capital, and the rent owed the landowner, as the prime factors in the price of commodities. It discusses the various ways in which capital can be more or less gainfully employed, and relates the origin and use of money to the accumulation and employment of capital. Examining the development of opulence in different nations and under different conditions, it compares the several systems of political economy, and argues for the beneficence of free trade.


[^6]: That, indeed, is the plot of every romance. To recognize this is to learn what it means to say that there are only a small number of plots in the world.

### Enumerate its Major Parts

Set forth the major parts of the book, and show how these are organized into a whole, by being ordered to one another and to the unity of the whole.

You have not grasped a complex unity if all you know about it is how it is one. You must also know how it is many, not a many that consists of a lot of separate things, but an organized many. If the parts were not organically related, the whole that they composed would not be one. Strictly speaking, there would be no whole at all but merely a collection. Remember the house analogy.

A formula can be stated for operating according to this third rule. It will guide you in a general way. According to the second rule, we had to say: The whole book is about so and so and such and such. That done, we might obey the third rule by proceeding as follows: (1) The author accomplished this plan in five major parts, of which the first part is about so and so, the second part is about such and such, the third part is about this, the fourth part about that, and the fifth part about still another thing. (2) The first of these major parts is divided into three sections, of which the first considers X, the second considers Y, and the third considers Z. (3) In the first section of the first part, the author makes four points, of which the first is A, the second

Be careful in how far you go into this. Depending on what want from the book, you might stop at a rough mental outline to a deep breakdown that goes down several levels. This could be abused to end being longer than the book. A good rule always describes the ideal performance. But a person can be skilled in an art without being the ideal artist. If you've got what you wanted from the breakdown, stop.

Your outlines may not matche the author's chapter divisions. He did it in order to write the book. You're doing it in order to read the book. Even if yours is not as good as his. But do use his titles, headings and subheadings as guides.

As you outline this book in analytical reading (by deepening your inspectional reading), your original unity that you wrote during inspectional reading could change as your understanding deepens

### Define Problem(s) Author Tried to Solve

You should be able to state the main question that the book tries to answer, and you should be able to state the subordinate questions if the main question is complex and has many parts. Which are primary and which secondary? Which questions must be answered first, if others are to be answered later?

If you know the kinds of questions anyone can ask about anything, you will become adept in detecting an author’s problems. Some theoratical questions:
* Does something exist?
* What kind of thing is it?
* What caused it to exist, or under what conditions can it exist, or why does it exist?
* What purpose does it serve?
* What are the consequences of its existence?
* What are its characteristic properties, its typical traits?
* What are its relations to other things of a similar sort, or of a different sort?
* How does it behave?

Some pratical ones:
* What ends should be sought?
* What means should be chosen to a given end?
* What things must one do to gain a certain objective, and in what order?
* Under these conditions, what is the right thing to do, or the better rather than the worse?
* Under what conditions would it be better to do this rather than that?

You'd have to adapt them for imaginative literature.

# Note Taking

Using Kindle Oasis, we can adapt author's suggestion of taking notes.

#### Inspectional/Structural

For this reading take non-canvas notes. This will allow you to distingquish between structural notes and conceptual notes.


#### Analytical/Conceptual

UNDERLINING—of major points; of important or forceful statements.

BOOKMARK PAGE & WRITE "MP" NEXT TO A MAJOR POINT—to be used sparingly, to emphasize the ten or dozen most important statements or passages in the book. You will be able to take the book off the shelf at any time and, by opening it to the bookmarked pages, refresh your recollection. Do not bookmark pages for other purposes.

NUMBERS IN THE MARGIN & HIGHLIGHT SENTENCE—to indicate a sequence of points made by the author in developing an argument. Maybe an argument's keyword to remember which argument the propositions are referring to. e.g. "Love is life argument", you'd note "LIL p3" for love is life proposition 3.

HIGHLIGHT KEYWORDS- to inditicate a keyword (term). So highlighting is used for keywords and key sentences that lead to arguments. Keyword -> Key sentence -> Argument.

HIGHLIGHTED SENTENCES WITHOUT NUMBERS- are key sentences, but not necessarly part of a larger argument. They might be the complete argument.

WRITING IN THE MARGIN, OR AT THE TOP OR BOTTOM OF THE PAGE—
  * to record questions (and perhaps answers) which a passage raises in your mind;
  * to reduce a complicated discussion to a simple statement;
  * to record the sequence of major points right through the book.

PERSONAL INDEX- Add a canvas on the endpapers at the back of the book and use it to make a personal index of the author’s points in the order of their appearance. You can extract those from highlighted sentences in the book. With and without numbers in the margin.

WEB PAGE FOR THE BOOK- After finishing the book and making your personal index on the back endpapers, create a webpage on your site, nashkabbara.com, and try to outline the book, not page by page or point by point (you have already done that at the back), but as an integrated structure, with a basic outline and an order of parts. That outline will be the measure of your understanding of the work; It will express your intellectual ownership of the book.

#### Syntopical/Dialectical

In addition to the conceptual notes, you'll need an external notebook to index different books.

### Types of Books (TODO: Lookup definitions of each type to help me detect it)
* Expository
    * Theoratical: that something is the case (it is the case that).
        * History: narration of past events and their place.
        * Science: things outside the scope of your normal, routine, daily experience. Lab.
        * Mathematics
        * Philosophy: experiences that are common to all.
        * Social Science
    * Practical: how to do something (should, ought, good, bad, ends and means). Guidebooks, art to be learned, manuals, engineering, medicine, cooking, economics, ethics, political.
* Imaginative
    * Stories
    * Epics
    * Plays
    * Tragedy
    * Lyric Poetry

### Words of Wisdom & Insights
* Classes of books[^2]:
    * [one chapter books] 99% of all books ever written can be satisfied with an inspectional reading.
    * [hard books] 0.01% of books make severe demands on you, but you may reach their level after your first analytical read. You only return to them to refresh your memory.
    * [desert island books] 0.001% of all books will never be grasped by you. Each analytical read will stretch you more. Seek them out!
* Only books that are beyond you will improve your analytical reading skill and will expand your wisdom.
* Informative books cause a quantitative change in information in you, but no improvement in reading skill nor wisdom.
* They body is limited and declines after 30. The mind keeps groing indefinitely. But it can atrophy like the muscles if it is not constantly growing intellectually, morally and spiritually. When it ceases to grow, we begine to die.
* Beware of the illusion that you're using your mind when you're just reacting to stimuli and hording information: documentaries, amusement, online courses, media, etc...
* To be informed is to know simply that something is the case. To be enlightened is to know, in addition, what it is all about: why it is the case, what its connections are with other facts, in what respects it is the same, in what respects it is different, and so forth.
* The person who has had one experience in acquiring a complex skill knows that he need not fear the array of rules that present themselves at the beginning of something new to be learned. He knows that he does not have to worry about how all the separate acts in which he must become separately proficient are going to work together. The multiplicity of the rules indicates the complexity of the one habit to be formed, not a plurality of distinct habits. The parts coalesce and telescope as each reaches the stage of automatic execution. When all the subordinate acts can be done more or less automatically, you have formed the habit of the whole performance. Then you can think about tackling an expert run you have never skied before, or reading a book that you once thought was too difficult for you. At the beginning, the learner pays attention to himself and his skill in the separate acts. When the acts have lost their separateness in the skill of the whole performance, the learner can at last pay attention to the goal that the technique he has acquired enables him to reach.
* Any art or skill is possessed by those who have formed the habit of operating according to its rules.
* The reader tries to uncover the skeleton that the book conceals. The author starts with the skeleton and tries to cover it up.


[^2]: 'one chapter books' refers to books that could have been written in one chapter. 'desert island books' are one of the ten books that you'd take with you to a desert island.


### Raw Notes From Book
