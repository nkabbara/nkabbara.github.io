## Your thoughts aren't true

### About you not them
See yourself from the other side of the river. You have an accent.

###  You can't trust your mind
When he finds out his mind has been tricking him, it’s upsetting, but he adapts. His mind was at odds with reality but can now see the difference. It’s even a relief, because it explains some frustrating moments of confusion in his past.

He carefully proceeds with less confidence and more humility. So can you.

### Re edit your mind's movies
It replays those same scenes it showed before, but now with a different edit.

When he focuses on the bad memories, her breakup is not confusing or even painful. This perspective helps him make peace with the past and move on.

Replay your past from different angles until you find the lesson or closure you need.

### Hanging inherited paintings

We inherit pictures of how to think and act, and tend to keep them as-is, even if they’re problematic.

This is the interior design of your mind—your internal environment. Take these paintings out under a bright light to be reframed. When you remove the frame and flip them upside-down, you can make sure they’re hanging the right way. Or decide to throw them away.

### MAke beleive

Beliefs have a purpose. They help us adopt a perspective or identity. They help us take action, or cooperate with others. The only problem is when we confuse belief with reality, and insist that something is absolutely true because we believe it.

All beliefs are make believe.

### Beliefs are not fact

You say “I believe” when it’s not a fact that everyone can see. Since people view it differently, you share your perspective on how you see

Beliefs are a stance on what’s inconclusive. You have to say “I believe …” because it’s not the only answer. It’s not a fact. (Not yet.)


### The more emotional, the less true

Wow, look at all that emotion! It must actually be true! Yeah, right.

If it was absolutely objectively true, there would be no need to get upset. You could just point to the conclusive proof. That’s that.

Instead, you might be using that word “believe” to mean “my identity depends on this”. Especially if you feel the need to tell everyone your beliefs.


### Your first thought is an obstacle

So your wisdom has to go against your instincts, and remind yourself the lines are actually the same, even though it feels wrong. You override your instincts with wisdom.

Your first thought is an obstacle. You need to get past it. Outsmart it.

Your instinct never goes away. But let your wisdom have the final say.

### Fill your sense with reality


Nature carries on. Humans are just another chattering species, making noise like birds and dogs.


Almost nothing people say is true. My thoughts aren’t true. Norms, obligations, the past, the future, and fears: none of it is real. They’re just thoughts formed into stories. Out here, they don’t exist.

Questions:

* How do we test what are learning here? In tango, we have a milonga to test our skills and beleifs and points of view. Where can we test these rewirings in here?

### Reframe

Explore many different ways of looking at your situation — finding perspectives you’d never considered before.

Think a different way and you’ll feel a different way. You choose your reaction. Not the first one, but the next.

1. Something happens.
2. Get past your first emotional reaction.
3. Consider other ways of looking at it.
4. Pick one that feels empowering or useful.
5. It shapes how you feel and what you’ll do.

Other people’s judgements, values, and meanings are also inside of you, but you can replace these with your own.

If you don’t choose your perspectives then you leave them up to mood, manipulation, or your worst impulses. Control your thoughts or be controlled.

“What’s great about this?”,
Don’t be so sure. Push past that first thought. Keep asking. You can always find something useful.

Use what you learned from jigsaw puzzles. Start with the edges. Come up with extreme and ridiculous ideas that you’d never actually do, but are good for inspiration and finding the middle.

You seem to be locked in a jail cell. But if you know there’s actually a secret exit, you’ll look harder, pushing and pulling everything until you find

Your mind has a lot of trash, and often tells you there’s no way out of your situation — there’s nothing great about this. But if you decide that there is, you’ll keep looking until you find it.

To change, reach past what comes naturally. Avoid your defaults. Get guidance outside of yourself. Use a different tool. How To Live is oblique strategies.

Trails of useful perspectives:
* Direct: Go directly for what I really want, instead of using other means to get there. What do I really want? And what’s the point of that? Am I keeping a job just to feel secure? Getting a university degree for the status? Starting a business for the freedom? Instead, find a more efficient path to the real end result.
* Energizing: Inspires to get immediate action.
* Self-reliant: It’s about the process, not the outcome.
* Balancing: Prioritize what’s been neglected.
* Selfless: “Useful” means for them and the greater good.
* Selfish: Protect the goose
* Lucid & lastting: Coming from a good state of mind, not angry, hurt, envious, or upset — not even ecstatically happy. Good in a few weeks as it is now?
* Test first: then commit after a few tests
* Healthy: Ask my idealized highest self how to think of this.
* Long-term: In the big picture of my whole life, this is just a phase. Keep my eyes on the horizon. Short-term discomfort or pain can bring a deeply fulfilling reward. Serve the future.
* Compensating for bias and prejudice: curved bowling

Examples:
* Silver medalist vs. bronze medalist
* Guess my secret number between 1 and 100
* Two Japanese in Brazil
* No one leaves a bad relationship
* NOLA's funerals
