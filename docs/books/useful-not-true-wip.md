## Your thoughts aren't true

### About you not them
See yourself from the other side of the river. You have an accent.

###  You can't trust your mind
When he finds out his mind has been tricking him, it’s upsetting, but he adapts. His mind was at odds with reality but can now see the difference. It’s even a relief, because it explains some frustrating moments of confusion in his past.

He carefully proceeds with less confidence and more humility. So can you.

### Re edit your mind's movies
It replays those same scenes it showed before, but now with a different edit.

When he focuses on the bad memories, her breakup is not confusing or even painful. This perspective helps him make peace with the past and move on.

Replay your past from different angles until you find the lesson or closure you need.

### Hanging inherited paintings

We inherit pictures of how to think and act, and tend to keep them as-is, even if they’re problematic.

This is the interior design of your mind—your internal environment. Take these paintings out under a bright light to be reframed. When you remove the frame and flip them upside-down, you can make sure they’re hanging the right way. Or decide to throw them away.

### MAke beleive

Beliefs have a purpose. They help us adopt a perspective or identity. They help us take action, or cooperate with others. The only problem is when we confuse belief with reality, and insist that something is absolutely true because we believe it.

All beliefs are make believe.

### Beliefs are not fact

You say “I believe” when it’s not a fact that everyone can see. Since people view it differently, you share your perspective on how you see

Beliefs are a stance on what’s inconclusive. You have to say “I believe …” because it’s not the only answer. It’s not a fact. (Not yet.)


### The more emotional, the less true

Wow, look at all that emotion! It must actually be true! Yeah, right.

If it was absolutely objectively true, there would be no need to get upset. You could just point to the conclusive proof. That’s that.

Instead, you might be using that word “believe” to mean “my identity depends on this”. Especially if you feel the need to tell everyone your beliefs.


### Your first thought is an obstacle

So your wisdom has to go against your instincts, and remind yourself the lines are actually the same, even though it feels wrong. You override your instincts with wisdom.

Your first thought is an obstacle. You need to get past it. Outsmart it.

Your instinct never goes away. But let your wisdom have the final say.

### Fill your sense with reality


Nature carries on. Humans are just another chattering species, making noise like birds and dogs.


Almost nothing people say is true. My thoughts aren’t true. Norms, obligations, the past, the future, and fears: none of it is real. They’re just thoughts formed into stories. Out here, they don’t exist.

Questions:

* How do we test what are learning here? In tango, we have a milonga to test our skills and beleifs and points of view. Where can we test these rewirings in here?
