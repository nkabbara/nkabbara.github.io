Anthony de Mello recounting a story by Zhuang Zhou and spicing it up a bit with his charm. Here goes:

> When the archer shoots for nothing, he has all his skill.
>
> When he shoots for a [bronze medal] he is already nervous.
>
> When he shoots for the [gold medal] he sees two targets.
> He is out of his mind.
>
> His skill has not changed, but the prize divides him.
> He cares. He thinks more of winning than of shooting.
>
> And the need to win drains him of power.

Imagine living your life for no prize. Will you have all your skill?
