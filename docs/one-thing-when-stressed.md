_Actually, two things._

First, take a full breath in, followed by another smaller breath to fill your
lungs a little bit more. Then, breath out slowly letting the exhale take about
four seconds. **Repeat a few times until [you](/how-are-you) feel a change in context.**

The other thing: notice how your vision is narrow and focused now. Stressfull situations
do that. Expand your vision by extending your arm in front of you drawing an oval
which sides touch the periphery of your vision. Imagin yourself in the middle of this
oval. **Repeat a few times until you feel a change in perspective.**

You can do both simultaneously.

**Why?**

Your brain changes your breath and your vision when it's stressed. Breath is held and
vision is narrowed. Amazingly, changing your breath and vision changes your brain's state too[^1].

The next step is to decide what the next step is, but with a calm breath and wide vision.
Re-focus without fear.

**The Catch**

When you're under stress, this is going to be the last thing you'll remember. To increase the
chances of doing it, practice it daily when you're not stressed.
