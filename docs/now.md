## Reading & Camping

I just paused a long chapter of working as a Software Engineer for a while. I have a good idea of what my next project is, but I'm creating some liminal space in which I get to shift some perspectives before diving into my next quest. I'm excited to go deep into a few books that I've already read a few times, but haven't completely internalized _(See analytical reading in this [awesome book](https://www.amazon.com/How-Read-Book-Classic-Intelligent/dp/0671212095).)_. List below will turn into links once my notes are up.

- Atomic Habits
- How To Live

I'm backpacking and camping around Argentina while in this liminal space. Reach out if you'd like to join in!

## Bikram Yoga

I'm a couple of years into Bikram and now can't imagine living without it. It's one of those activities that insidiously grabs you and never lets go. Like a fungus. I'm advanced in a couple of poses, intermediate in a few and beginner in the rest. I focus on one pose for a few weeks or months and once satisfied with some progress, I shift focus to the another one. At this rate, it'll take me several years to reach intermediate/advanced in all poses.

## Argentine Tango

I've been dabbling in tango for several years now, but now that I live in Buenos Aires I'm starting to go deep. Tango, in its totality, the movement aspect, its social dynamics, and the mindset shifts it demands of you is the hardest thing I've been involved in. It's a complete ecosystem that has enough metaphors to reflect most aspects of life in general.

## Buenos Aires & Spanish Reboot

I moved to Latin America in May 2019 after living most of my life in Houston,TX and I'm still learning Spanish! As soon as my level reached order-food level, complaining-about-slow-internet level, and dating-level I stopped learning and surfed that plateau for a few years. But life in Buenos Aires is very different than the cities I've lived in in Mexico. People here are very friendly and more inclusive than Mexico, so I keep finding myself in Spanish only groups and events. This has generated a renewed motivation to take my Spanish to the next level.

My current daily routine is 30 minutes divided between Ankiing new words and going through [Language Transfer's](https://www.languagetransfer.org/) awesome Spanish course. As soon as that comes to an end I'm switching to conversational in person classes. I'm also considering an alternative where I deep dive for a couple of months dropping all other activities and put it behind me.
