# Embodying an Identity

I decided that I am a dancer, but I was suddenly hit with the realization that I had no idea how to embody an identity. It's not like becoming a millionair where I could print out my bank balance to prove that I'm one. Did that mean that I had to compete in some championship to win a trophy as proof? I see men in their 20s and others in their 70s at milongas that everyone bows to in respect due to how good they are. They ARE dancers and they don't have any trophies.

In his book, Useful Not True, Derek Sivers says that you don't have to feel like someone to be that someone.

> Your outside doesn't need to match your inside.
> You can feel terrified inside, but just pretend to be brave for one minute. By doing that, you were actually brave.

Does this mean that to be a dancer, I just had to pretend that I am one and eventually I will become one?

> You are your actions. Your actions are you. Your self-image doesn't matter as much.

> When you realize what you need to do, it doesn't mean that's who you need to be. You can just pretend.

> You can imitate your role model. Many top performers have an alter ego — a Jekyll to their Hyude or vice-versa — a side of themselves they personify and bring out when needed. It's not Maria who negotiates. It's El Tigre.

When I read that I realized that I had an imminant task ahead. It's not Nash that dancers. It's _____. Who's going to be my alter ego?

## Ideas

* Are you a frog or a horse: use analogies of types of people and how to break them in. Boling frogs (gradual or immidiate like breaking in a horse). Study the sources of these to see how you can work them in at some point into this chapter.
* Remember that eventually we need to revisit rejection in this chapter and how we got over it by embodying the identity of a dancer.
