_What's the point of this chapter? Decide to be something and become it._

I was in La Viruta watching a man dancing as if he were the fifth instrument of a live quartet playing D'arienzo. I decided that I wanted to be him, a true milonguero.

I worked hard for more than half of my life at shedding identities. I succeeded too much. I thought that with a shrinking footprint of identities I would eventually get to the baseline of simply being a good human free of unneceray baggage. Not Christian, Not American, Not Middle Class, Not Programmer,  I would become spiritual, wordly, unpredjudiced and multi-disciplinary. I would be able to slide in and out of ecosystems, learn, contribute and get out. I became irate when people referred to me as an American or a dancer [^1]. What I didn't realize until years later was that I created an identity of no identities and I was becoming overprotective of it. A genuine agnostic, undecided on everything. [I think there's room for expansion here to make next paragraph more impactful]

_maybe add how I felt anxious when the thought of happyness associated wiht an identity came up: no, I must be happy without that. I don't need that to be happy. This thought process was keeping me on the fence. An armchari observer. One may need to get messy to get the most out of life. eg. the guy that says I don't take it very seriously._

It was time to mark this as a lesson learned and start looking for identities I wanted to assume—a perk only available to folks that threw their identity shirts in the heavy duty cycle.

"How does one build a milonguero identity?" was the question that kept me up at night and eventually lead me to an adventure in the underworld of the Buenos Aires milonga scene that changed me forever.

My weakest point was that I was an introvert. I did well in classes, but as soon as the milonga started to form, my mind started plotting the fastest route to the exit. There was an invisible and stubborn pull that wanted me to leave this new place with these new people. I had to find a way to work with my introversion. My way was to add a rule that prevented me from leaving the building: "You may not leave the building until you've danced at least one tanda" and over time I increased that number to five—the counter became my crutch whenever my rules became difficult, reset to one and work back up to five—that rule worked, but I've quickly found a way around it; I only danced with familiar people and friends. And they usally cared more about friend things than dance things—in close embrace, my mouth to their ear and theirs to mine we gossiped our brains out about anything that moved. I became aware of my mind's procaltivity to find the easiest path and added the following provision to my rule: "...A tanda is counted only when danced with a new person." For serveral weeks after that rule had been activated I had my eye out for a new person in the form of a helpless creature taking their first class and clearly wishing that anyone with a pulse would ask them for a dance. I granted them their wish and they granted me persmission to go home. Mutual salvation. It was time to add a clause to prevent these shananigans "...The new person must be intimidating to me." I was intimidated by beautiful women and by good dancers. I couldn't go home unless I danced with either. I tensed up tremendously when adding that rule, but it occurred to me that every night when I go home, I'm guaranteed to say that I've danced with a beautiful woman or a good dancer. What a strange thing to be intimidated by. Nevertheless this was difficult so I leaned on my crutch and reset it back to one.

I started being rejected. Not so much by beautiful dancers—many never put in the effort to remove their training wheels, so it wasn't enjoyable dancing with them—but by good dancers. In tango good dancers will not give intermediate peasants a minute of their time. Unless they want to fuck them. Many didn't want to fuck me. I had some success to lean on: I used to run home after class, but now I'm staying a couple of hours afterwards. But rejection is a phenomenon that I'm pretty sure inspired Buddha to create buddhism. How was I going to solve a multi-thousand year old problem that kept millions of men lounging in their comfort zones?

My milonga rule in its entirety at that point was: "I may not leave the building until you've danced at least one tanda. A tanda is counted only when danced with a new person that intimidates me. Increase the number of tandas weekly."

Rejection was starting to show holes in my rule, but it was a horse that got me pretty far. I used to be the guy that would run home after class, but a kind and gentle rule, helped me work my way up, at first dancing with friends, then with helpless beginners, then with gorgeous women and better dancers and it got me to the front door of skilled dancers though they wouldn't open the door. It was time to dismount the horse, but my debt to it didn't end there. It provided me with a nugget of self wisdom that changed how I think about myself; I had always assumed that I was an introvert and that when I went out of my apartment, I needed an equal or greater amount of time in it when I returned. After big events, I would spend a full day at home in bed hugging my pillows tensly listening to loud sad music [mention the band] to recover. Completely disfunctional. But now I went to a class with twenty people that don't speak my language and I stayed at milongas with a hundred more and danced and mingled with people in broken Spanish and I went home with full energy ready to repeat the whole thing the following day. How was I an introvert?  It seemed like a misdiagnosis that gave me too much cause to shelter myself more than I needed to. I started to notice that only when I went to new places I would need recovery time the following day, but if I went to a familiar place, I was fine. The revelation was that it was stress[^2] that was turning me into a pillow hugger, not introversion. This freed me from the introvert label and gave me new ways to deal with this type of problem. My primary defense against depletion was first to avoid new events and if I had to do them, I had to plan a day or two of recovery afterwards making my milonguero quest untenable. But now instead of avoiding milongas, I built gardual familiarity with them. That was my key in lowering stress. I modified my milonga rule, compressing it and expanding it to work for many other situations, including conferences and challenging treks. The basic theme was build familiarity by progressing gently and regressing kindly. Repeat until you're at home with your people[^3].

[^2]: agoraphobia? It seems it's like new places and new people. Maybe new people more than new places.

[^3]: For one time type events, think of the place as a circle and if the center is your goal, work at the periphery meeting the most gentle people and familiarizing youreslf with the outer physical place. Even the furniture.

Rejection was hard. When it was being nice, it ruined my night. When it was being a bitch it made me doubt my self. I went down the usual route and applied every trick in every self help book: it's not me, it's them. It's a good thing in disguise. It builds resilience. All these could be true, but still, rejection was hard. I had to revisit my milonguer quest and truly understand why was it something that I wanted to do? Why does it have so much pull on me and hadn't let me go of me all these years? What was it about watching that man at the beginning of the chapter that made it ok to have to deal with the challenges it takes to be like him?

It was two things that made him so appealing. First, he was there with a table of friends that seemed to know each other for many years. They ate, they drank, they laughed, they talked and they danced way beyond midnight and then walked each other home when the band was packing their purcioussion. I imagined myself having a regular weeknight or two where I would go to a table full of friends with my seat always reserved and that we would eat, drink, laugh, talk and dance until the waiters have had enough. The second appeal was as deep as good friendships: play. When he got up to dance, whether a slow sad song or a jumpy and happy song he was playing. Play in its many forms, drawing songs on the floor with his feet, flirting with his partner in front of her lover, turning music into expression, wearing ridiculous clothes because he can. Yes, the struggle to have that aspect of his being was worth it for me and I was already starting to glimpse at the possibilities. Regulars that have been seeing me return constantly have become more inviting and friendlier over the months and I was being invited to join some of their tables. My dance was starting to improve to where I could feel like I could master certain aspect of it and turn it into pure enjoyment and at times my limitation was my partner; she didn't have the technique to play with me. That was what made rejection by good dancers OK and welcome. It meant I had more work to do, but it also objectified and clarified rejection. Unlike a video game with clear level demarcation, my demarcations here were skilled dancers saying no. I was forced to pay attention to the gradiation between good dancers: who has just entered the castle of skill versus who was the queen of skill. If I could figure that out, I could manage my rejections by starting with least skilled and work my way up. I don't see skilled dancers as a black box. My quest now was to play and I wanted to play with the best players because it was more fun.

My teacher said that I had ten years of hard work ahead of me if I wanted to play with the cool kids. Can I do it in one?

I revisited my rule to see how I can expand it to help me navigate my updated quest, but something felt wrong. I couldn't imagine a world as rich and deep as Argentine Tango navigated with rules alone.

Argentine Tango begins with the embrace. It's the cornerstone of everything. You either give your soul up completely to your partner or you don't. There is no in between. I am not talking about technique like where to place your hand on her back and how your elbows should touch and how to relax your shoulders and how to hold her hand and how to position your head. I am talking about giving up your soul. Think of the things about you that make you the most embarrased and most ashamed and imagine yourself telling them to someone you don't yet completely trust, someone you decided to give a chance with your deepest secrets. You know that they will hear the quiver in your voice and see how you look when you feel unworthy of love. You're so close together that she can feel your heart beat communicating all these vulnerabilities and you can feel hers reacting to them. All this is happening in the first few seconds of the dance. You haven't even started yet. I only learned what the embrace meant when I moved to Argentina. One evening, my Argentine friend led me into a party and when we arrived he hugged the first person he saw—for what seemed like an enternity—then they kissed and had a quick conversation though it felt like they exchanged more  than small talk. I shook that persons hand keeping a safe, American 10 foot distance. When he ran into the next person, the same thing transpired until we reached his circle of actual friends—about 14 people sitting in an actual circle—and the hugs and kisses ensued at whole different level. To my horror, they wouldn't accept my 10 foot distanced hand shake and each would pull me in for a hug and kiss. What a nightmear. I said to myself that I'm never going out again in Argentina. As the days went by, I started to see this everywhere: the barbershop next to my regular restaurant is regularly fronted by the owner hanging out with his son, the son's feet raised on his dad's lap, the dad's hand massaging the son's neck while they're conversing. My dad sends me a happhy new year text message on New Year Day and a happy birthday message usually one or two days after my birthday. Argentina is different. They know how to love and how to show it there. I needed to start by being comfortable with hugging and kissing and loving and showing it.

If the Argentine Tango embrace is giving up your soul, then the Argentine Tango music is giving up your body. Dancers that have been dancing the same song since they could walk don't know how they're going to dance that song on any given day. The song has many layers and a dancer could pick a layer and dance it for the whole tanda or they could mix and match between the layers dancing different rhythms and different melodies. The leader could decide to let his partner dance small parts of the song or take full control and lead every single step. Not even he knows what's going to happen. It has more to do with his mood that day and how it's unfolding than it does with his decisions of how to dance. I on the other hand, plan my whole week down to the hour every Saturday. My planner has items that read "Sleep 8 hours",  "Drink coffee at 8am", "Go to the bathroom before starting work" and so on until bedtime. This plan is driven by and optimized for some higher order goal that I put in place at the start of the year. I revise my plan and how I'm going about it weekly. My first question to my tango teacher who lived on the 14th floor of a highrise was, how can I write down every single step I'm going to dance so I could memorize it and dance better. She started to look for the nearest window to jump out of. The dance is deeply structured, yet it's fundamentaly improvised. I had a hard time holding these two opposing ideas in my head at the same time. It goes against my being.

_give your soul in paragraph above, give up your body in this paragraph._

After the embrace comes the music.
* Talk about the improviasional aspects of the music and how the man leads it and how the follower must follow yet exert her myself. No structure for a man like me of structure.
* Connect with the immigrate nature, the fleeteness of life



_Rule worked, but I'm still at the periphery, I need to be in this thing_

_But with rejection we need smething more than rules. We need a mindset shift. Thust the dancer._

* -[x] I started to think more about rejections from good dancers. Well, why do I want to dance with good dancers? To play. Forgetting playfullness.
* Describe what hard work in tango is. Here go crazy. Focus on the embrace. How the argentine embrace is. Describe the argentine people.
* No rules and todos can help with all that. We need a mindset shift. The rules kept us at the periphery, what we need is smoething to puts us int the game.
* Segway is the trials of tribulations of being a dancer.

Remember this is me predicting my future. This could change tremendously.

How all these rules were kinda working but I was still out in the fringes dabling. When I assume the dancer identity, I was in it. No more fringes. I was playing the game.
