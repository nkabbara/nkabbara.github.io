What's the point of this chapter? Decide to be something and become it.

- what does it mean to be a something
- why it's tough to accomplish dancer identity in tango
- How I came to decide.
- What happened when I decided - here we can imagine how we imagine we will be when we become what we want to become. Now shit is exciting.

I have been working hard for more than half of my life at shedding identities. I succeeded too much. I thought that with a shrinking footprint of identities I would eventually get to the baseline of simply being a good human; without religious, nationalisitic, classist or professional associations I would become spiritual, wordly, unpredjudiced and multi-disciplinary. I imagined that without all that baggage, I will be able to slide in and out of ecosystems, learn and contribute and get out. I became irate when people referred to me as an American, a programmer or a dancer [^1]. What I didn't realized was that I created an identity of no identities and I was protecting it from any lable thrown at me. There was no way around it, one must be something.

After the pain from my giant misstep has subdued, I realized that I'm now well positioned to assume any identities that my heart yearned for. But what does it mean to be a something: American, programmer, dancer, or a Christian?

I decided develop a theory around what makes a human something and to test it. To be something, you first must understand what it is. To be something you must choose it and it must choose you. To be something, you must give it what it requires of you. To be something, you must be immersed in it for as long as your life permits.

I knew very clearly which identity I wanted to assume first. A Milonguero. Here's a slice of a Milonguero's life. After he's done with his responsibilities for the day he dresses up and grooms himself. He goes to his favorite milonga for the night and sits on a table with this friends that are already there. He dances a few dances with them to catch up on the day between songs. And now the night begins: he starts looking for the dancer that he feels a pull towards. An energy that connects them that is telling him to stay on her and she feels it too. When she finally does he cabaceos her and she agrees. He goes to her table and leads her into the dance floor. The first dance is a simple oranment just to confirm their connection. Was it a mirage? Is there something deep for them to experience that evening? The only way to do this is by giving her his full being through his embrace. Everything about his existence is hers. He is her. He's sitting the cavity in her chest next to her heart and she can feel him there. Or not. He probably made a mistake. After the tanda is over he takes her back and never dances with her again. But he continues looking until hopefully, he does find her and when he does, the only reason to stop dancing would be to rest his body and let her rest hers. But he knows that for the rest of the night, they'll be dancing for hours together painting the floor with their art.
