- what does it mean to be a something
- why it's tough to accomplish dancer identity in tango
- here I need more material...

I have been working hard for more than half of my life at shedding identities. I succeeded too much. My idea behind that quest was that with a small footprint of things I identified with I would I be freer and eventually get to the baseline of simply being a good human; without religious, nationalisitic, classist or  professional associations. This would help me become spiritual, wordly, unpredjudiced and multi-disciplinary. I imagined that without all that baggage, I will be able to slide in and out of ecosystems, learn and contribute and get out when I feel like I've reached satisfaction. My success in this endeavor is evident in my reaction when people referred to me as an American, programmer or milonguero. I became uncomfortable and proceed to explain why I am not such a label [^1].

What I had forgotten was that the whole purpose of shedding auto assigned identities was to be able to go back and choose identities that I wanted. Not ones that culture or mommy and daddy had ingrained into me. That was an expensive oversight because identities are powerful mechanisms to commit me to something and push  me to protect it. Furthermore, I had worked hard on resiting idententies instead of embracing ones that are good for me.
