What's the point of this chapter? Decide to be something and become it.

- 0 Identities
- what does it mean to be a dancher - be specific
- why it's tough to accomplish dancer identity in tango
- How I came to decide.
- What happened when I decided - here we can imagine how we imagine we will be when we become what we want to become. Now shit is exciting.

I was in La Viruta watching a man dancing as if he were the fifth instrument of a live quartet playing D'arienzo. I decided that I wanted to be him, a true milonguero.

I worked hard for more than half of my life at shedding identities. I succeeded too much. I thought that with a shrinking footprint of identities I would eventually get to the baseline of simply being a good human free of unneceray baggage. Not Christian, Not American, Not Middle Class, Not Programmer,  I would become spiritual, wordly, unpredjudiced and multi-disciplinary. I would be able to slide in and out of ecosystems, learn, contribute and get out. I became irate when people referred to me as an American or a dancer [^1]. What I didn't realize until years later was that I created an identity of no identities and I was becoming overprotective of it. A genuine agnostic, undecided on everything.

It was time to mark this as a lesson learned and start looking for identities I wanted to assume—a perk only available to folks that threw their identity shirts in the heavy duty cycle.

"How does one build a milonguero identity?" was the question that kept me up at night and eventually lead me to an adventure in the underworld of the Buenos Aires milonga scene that changed me forever.

My weakest point was that I was an introvert. I did well in classes, but as soon as the milonga started to form, my mind started plotting the fastest route to the exit. I had to find a way to work with my introversion. My way was to add a rule that prevented me from leaving the building: "You may not leave the building until you've danced at least one tanda" and over time I increased that number to five—the counter became my crutch whenever my rules became difficult, reset to one and work back up to five—that rule worked, but I've quickly found a way around it; I only danced with familiar people and friends. And they usally cared more about friend things than dance things—in close embrace, my mouth to their ear and theirs to mine we gossiped our brains out about anything that moved. I became aware of my mind's procaltivity to find the easiest path and added the following provision to my rule: "...A tanda is counted only when danced with a new person." For serveral weeks after that rule had been activated I had my eye out for a new person in the form of a helpless creature taking their first class and clearly wishing that anyone with a pulse would ask them for a dance. I granted them their wish and they granted me persmission to go home. Mutual salvation. It was time to add a clause to prevent these shananigans "...The new person must be intimidating to me." I was intimidated by beautiful women and by good dancers. I couldn't go home unless I danced with either. I tensed up tremendously when adding that rule, but it occurred to me that every night when I go home, I'm guaranteed to say that I've danced with a beautiful woman or a good dancer. What a strange thing to be intimidated by. Nevertheless this was difficult so I leaned on my crutch and reset it back to one.

I started being rejected. Not so much by beautiful dancers—many never put in the effort to remove their training wheels, so it wasn't enjoyable dancing with them—but by good dancers. In tango good dancers will not give intermediate peasants a minute of their time. Unless they want to fuck them. Many didn't want to fuck me. I had some success to lean on: I used to run home after class, but now I'm staying a couple of hours afterwards. But rejection is a phenomenon that I'm pretty sure inspired Buddha to create buddhism. How was I going to solve a multi-thousand year old problem that kept millions of men lounging in their comfort zones?

My rule in its entirety at that point was: "You may not leave the building until you've danced at least one (increase by one weekly) tanda. A tanda is counted only when danced with a new person that intimidates me."

The rule helped tremendously. It helped me overcome my fear of staying at milongas. It gradually built resilience in me by taking the small and safe first step of dancing one tanda with a friendly partner to staying for hours hunting down anyone that would accept a dance. It then helped me make friends and get invited to tables with regulars. [keep going here with how that helped and end withthe most important one of how it made me discover that I was not introverted in the way I thought I was. What it was was stress...stress was what took a tole on me]

How do I go from here?
* I started getting rejections
* I didn't know how to deal with rejeactions. I needed more rejections to learn how to deal with them.
* State the rule in its entirety at this point.
* How I learned how to deal with rejection.
* How do I work in the choosing the be a dancer?

Remember this is me predicting my future. This could change tremendously.

How all these rules were kinda working but I was still out in the fringes dabling. When I assume the dancer identity, I was in it. No more fringes. I was playing the game.
