_What's the point of this chapter? Decide to be something and become it._

I was in La Viruta watching a man dancing as if he were the fifth instrument of a live quartet playing D'arienzo. I decided that I wanted to be him, a true milonguero.

I worked hard for more than half of my life at shedding identities. I succeeded too much. I thought that with a shrinking footprint of identities I would eventually get to the baseline of simply being a good human free of unneceray baggage. Not Christian, Not American, Not Middle Class, Not Programmer,  I would become spiritual, wordly, unpredjudiced and multi-disciplinary. I would be able to slide in and out of ecosystems, learn, contribute and get out. I became irate when people referred to me as an American or a dancer [^1]. What I didn't realize until years later was that I created an identity of no identities and I was becoming overprotective of it. A genuine agnostic, undecided on everything.

_maybe add how I felt anxious when the thought of happyness associated wiht an identity came up: no, I must be happy without that. I don't need that to be happy. This thought process was keeping me on the fence. An armchari observer. One may need to get messy to get the most out of life. eg. the guy that says I don't take it very seriously._

It was time to mark this as a lesson learned and start looking for identities I wanted to assume—a perk only available to folks that threw their identity shirts in the heavy duty cycle.

"How does one build a milonguero identity?" was the question that kept me up at night and eventually lead me to an adventure in the underworld of the Buenos Aires milonga scene that changed me forever.

My weakest point was that I was an introvert. I did well in classes, but as soon as the milonga started to form, my mind started plotting the fastest route to the exit. There was an invisible and stubborn pull that wanted me to leave this new place with these new people. I had to find a way to work with my introversion. My way was to add a rule that prevented me from leaving the building: "You may not leave the building until you've danced at least one tanda" and over time I increased that number to five—the counter became my crutch whenever my rules became difficult, reset to one and work back up to five—that rule worked, but I've quickly found a way around it; I only danced with familiar people and friends. And they usally cared more about friend things than dance things—in close embrace, my mouth to their ear and theirs to mine we gossiped our brains out about anything that moved. I became aware of my mind's procaltivity to find the easiest path and added the following provision to my rule: "...A tanda is counted only when danced with a new person." For serveral weeks after that rule had been activated I had my eye out for a new person in the form of a helpless creature taking their first class and clearly wishing that anyone with a pulse would ask them for a dance. I granted them their wish and they granted me persmission to go home. Mutual salvation. It was time to add a clause to prevent these shananigans "...The new person must be intimidating to me." I was intimidated by beautiful women and by good dancers. I couldn't go home unless I danced with either. I tensed up tremendously when adding that rule, but it occurred to me that every night when I go home, I'm guaranteed to say that I've danced with a beautiful woman or a good dancer. What a strange thing to be intimidated by. Nevertheless this was difficult so I leaned on my crutch and reset it back to one.

I started being rejected. Not so much by beautiful dancers—many never put in the effort to remove their training wheels, so it wasn't enjoyable dancing with them—but by good dancers. In tango good dancers will not give intermediate peasants a minute of their time. Unless they want to fuck them. Many didn't want to fuck me. I had some success to lean on: I used to run home after class, but now I'm staying a couple of hours afterwards. But rejection is a phenomenon that I'm pretty sure inspired Buddha to create buddhism. How was I going to solve a multi-thousand year old problem that kept millions of men lounging in their comfort zones?

My milonga rule in its entirety at that point was: "You may not leave the building until you've danced at least one tanda. A tanda is counted only when danced with a new person that intimidates me. Increase the number of tandas weekly."

Rejection was starting to show holes in my rule, but it was a horse that got me pretty far. I used to be the guy that would run home after class, but a rule that was kind and gentle, helped me work my way up, at first dancing with friends, then with helpless beginners, then with gorgeous women and better dancers and it got me to the front door of skilled dancers that wouldn't open the door. Though it was time to dismount the horse, my debt to it didn't end there. It provided me with a nugget of self wisdome that changed how I think about myself. I had always assumed that I was an introvert. That when I went out of my apartment, I needed an equal or greater amount of time in it when I returned. After big events, I would spend a full day at home in bed hugging my pillows tensly listening to loud sad music to recover. Completely disfunctional. But now I went to a class with twenty people that don't speak English and I stayed at milongas with a hundred more and danced and mingled with them in broken Spanish and I went home with full energy ready to repeat the whole thing the following day. Referring to myself as an introvert was too generic and gave me too much cause to shelter myself more than I needed to. It was stress[^2] that was turning me into a pillow hugger, not introversion. This changed my approach to events that were physically and mentally draining. My primary defense against depletion was first to avoid new events. If I had to do them, I planned a day or two of recovery afterwards. Which meant my planning was always centered around being in familiar places all week and only venturing out on Friday or Saturday giving myself recovery days. After my discovery, depletion avoidance changed to building familiarity—I didn't want to call it stress management so I don't get stuck in generalities again. That was my key in lowering stress. I modified my milonga rule, compressing it and expanding it to work for most situations, including barbeques where I only knew one person and dangerous treks in Patagonia. The basic theme was start easy and take small steps. Increase difficulty gradually and take a step or two back when things get tough. Try to take new steps on your next try.

_Rule worked, but I'm still at the periphery, I need to be in this thing_

_But with rejection we need smething more than rules. We need a mindset shift. Thust the dancer._

I started to think more about how to deal with rejection. There were popular techniques that people used mostly related to mindset shifts...._I started looking in chat panel to see how people do it what's recommeneded. Maybe more research here should help writing this. Remember, we are writing about our curret experiece, past experiece and where we'd like to be_.

How do I go from here?
* I started getting rejections
* I didn't know how to deal with rejeactions. I needed more rejections to learn how to deal with them.
* State the rule in its entirety at this point.
* How I learned how to deal with rejection.
* How do I work in the choosing the be a dancer?

Remember this is me predicting my future. This could change tremendously.

How all these rules were kinda working but I was still out in the fringes dabling. When I assume the dancer identity, I was in it. No more fringes. I was playing the game.
