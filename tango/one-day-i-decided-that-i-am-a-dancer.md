What's the point of this chapter? Decide to be something and become it.

- 0 Identities
- what does it mean to be a dancher - be specific
- why it's tough to accomplish dancer identity in tango
- How I came to decide.
- What happened when I decided - here we can imagine how we imagine we will be when we become what we want to become. Now shit is exciting.

I was in La Viruta watching a man dancing as if he were the fifth instrument of a live quartet playing D'arienzo. I decided that I wanted to be him, a true milonguero.

I worked hard for more than half of my life at shedding identities. I succeeded too much. I thought that with a shrinking footprint of identities I would eventually get to the baseline of simply being a good human free of unneceray baggage. Not Christian, Not American, Not Middle Class, Not Programmer,  I would become spiritual, wordly, unpredjudiced and multi-disciplinary. I would be able to slide in and out of ecosystems, learn, contribute and get out. I became irate when people referred to me as an American or a dancer [^1]. What I didn't realize until years later was that I created an identity of no identities and I was becoming overprotective of it. A genuine agnostic, undecided on everything.

It was time to mark this as a lesson learned and start looking for identities I wanted to assume—a perk only available to folks that threw their identity shirts in the heavy duty cycle.

"How does one build a milonguero identity?" was the question that kept me up at night and eventually lead me to an adventure in the underworld of the Buenos Aires milonga scene that changed me forever.

My weakest point was that I was an introvert. I did well in classes, but as soon as the milonga started to form, my mind started spitting out algorithms plotting the fastest route to the exit. I had to find a way to work with my introversion. My way was to add a rule that prevented me from leaving the building: "You may not leave the building until you've danced at least one tanda" and over time I increased that number to five. That worked, but I've quickly found a way around it; I only danced with familiar people and friends. And they usally cared more about friend things than dancing—dancing in close embrace, mouth to ear, gossiping about the people around us. I quickly became aware of my mind's trick and added the following provision to my rule: "...A tanda is counted only when danced with a new person." The power of my mind's creativity became aparent when I found myself dancing with new people, but only ones that I was sure were below my level. I eyed the cute girls in the beginners class and marked them as my salvation. They would be the reason why I could leave the building and rest in the safety of my apartment with my cat. And thus was born the most difficult stipulation of all "...The new person must be intimidating to me."
