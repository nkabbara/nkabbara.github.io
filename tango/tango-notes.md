A framework is finally starting to materialize in my head around how tango is structured. In this note, I plan to capture it so that later on I can break it down and organize it.

# Structure

## Basic elements

Each movement is made of the following elements.

1. Base leg bending
2. Rotation
3. Projection
4. Weight transfer

## Displacement

Displacements are ways in which we may combine the basic elements to create steps.

1. Project first
2. Transfer first
3. Project-transfer-project

### Ways to Displace

In relation to a dance partner's embrace, you may only displace in three ways:

1. Open step
2. Forward cross
3. Backward cross
