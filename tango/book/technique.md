# The Centimeter

I walked into a class where a renowed teacher had the floor and the attention of more than the 80 people in attendance. She said "you are all after this elusive and magical tango feeling, but you're all seeking it incorrectly." That grabbed my attention because I had just finished wrting the chapter on sysnching breath and becoming more uniated with my follower. "You all think that it's something spiritual where the planets need to be aligned in a certain way for you to sense it. But that's not how that feelings surfaces. You have to put in the work in to improve how you occupy space." At that point in my development I started to realized that all we are doing when dancing was learning how to free space that your partner is taking so I may occupy it. It's the most elemental function of tango. She continued "the difference between a dream dance and an OK dance is a centimeter. If you step a centimeter too far or too close your movement just went from dream like to OK. The same goes for you head, your torso you pelvis and your whole being. Always think of the centimeter." This was not some random teacher in Buenos Aires, she is one of the founders of El Motivo. El Motivo started to help break the status quo of the tango of the 2000's where strict pedodigal rules were of tango were followed in all milongas. It started to help spearhead the tango nuevo movement and to help dancer dance in an experimental fashion to explore and learn. Their teaching and practica has produced hundreds of dancers and 21 years later still holds the spot for the best place to be on any given Monday night. So when she spoke, you listened.

Her monologue made me doubt everything I had written about connecting with someone. Could all this just be a matter of technique?

At that time, I was in search of a teacher that can show me the light. My dance was stuck. It was basically a mixture of figures that I picked up over the years and a process of remembering what I know and trying to remind myself to dance them at milongas. I would forget a step, then remind myself to do it and then do it. There was no sense of creativity or dancing or doing something fun. It was repetitive. I was working on my own to try and figure it out while also seeking a teacher. My process in finding a teacher involved taking a bunch of classes with one I heard good things about. I gave them a couple of month of full dedication to see what they're about and how the teach and get a glimpse into the depth of their knowledge. Some I did so at group level and others that didn't have group offerings at private level. In 18 months I went through five teachers and each had something that made it a no go. I was starting to doubt my dancing ability. Is it me? Some of these teachers have produced great dancers so they definitely had something. Until one day, as I was doing research for my chapter on musicality, I was taking every musicality seminar in town. The teacher of my last seminar was a person that I would have built myself to be my teacher. He explained in ways that just made sense. He pointed out mistakes in my body. He tied the imaginary to the real using metaphors that held their ground in many ways. I put him through the two month test and at the end started praying that he would never gone from town. I would be his body guard for free just to protect him. That made me realize that my success in tango was highly dependant on finding the right teacher. I suspect it is the same for everyone and also in many discplines that are not institionalized. This teachers feedback had direct impact on my dance. He would tell me to do correct something, then he would dance it with me enough times until he felt that my body got it. Not necessaritly my mind. When we were both sure that there was both mental and physical colearning, he would them give me exercises or way to go practice it on my own. With this new way of learning I suddenly realized that the responsibility completely shifted to me now. I had the right instruction, I had to make sure I codified the information in a way where I could look it up and also and then a way to practice it with as many people as possible until it's become part of my dance. This meant many hours of writing and then experimenting with what I've learned, going back with questions and then re-applying the lessons. 

Unlocking my enjoyment of dancing happened on 2025/11/10. On that day, my dance changed from someone applying a repertoir of dance, a combo of 10 to 14 steps arranged in different ways to someone that is exploring possibilities. All it took was one class. The way people taught me dance before was let's work on some technique, ok good. Now here's a step for you to do. This will keep you stuck in that mode of many years to come. A good teacher will show you how to improvise from the start and then starts to hone down your improvisation by adding technique, showing what's tango and what's not tango, and what you might have trouble with and what you might not. Using that way, he allowed you creativity to take its course, without limiting it and allowed you find steps that he even hasn't thought about and then make sthem work. They are your steps. Your mind's steps. You discovered them. Now you will work on improving them. After that class and mkaing these realizatoin, I lost one category of anxiety. It's what to do next. That qustion never came up because I knoew that I coudl get into cross system and let whatever happens happen.

## Notes

Finding teachers that understand biomechanics is heard. Learning technique is hard and time instensive process.

Example of viquera's teaching and how I hurt everyone's shoulder. It works, but it hurts.

See bear notes for difference between good dancer and bad dancer.

I developed a litmus test that proves a teacher's technique ability. Found out that no one teachers knows it all. Need to find a teacher for different things.

Fixing technique takes a toll on all you movements until you are back to your baseline to and then you'll exceed it.

As you improve your technique you leave dancers behind.

All that is worth it because now you're dancing with more elegance and more eficiency. You are learning how to manage space with your body. You are learning the difference between displace and change of position. That's the curcial point in all of tango dance. You are moving a body into space and then you are occupying that space. That's your diplacement. All movement that are not displacement are positioning. When displacement happens you probably need to do something.
