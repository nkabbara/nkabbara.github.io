# Technique Set Me Free


## Notes

Finding teachers that understand biomechanics is heard. Learning technique is hard and time instensive process.

Example of viquera's teaching and how I hurt everyone's shoulder. It works, but it hurts.

See bear notes for difference between good dancer and bad dancer.

I developed a litmus test that proves a teacher's technique ability. Found out that no one teachers knows it all. Need to find a teacher for different things.

Fixing technique takes a toll on all you movements until you are back to your baseline to and then you'll exceed it.

As you improve your technique you leave dancers behind.

All that is worth it because now you're dancing with more elegance and more eficiency. You are learning how to manage space with your body. You are learning the difference between displace and change of position. That's the curcial point in all of tango dance. You are moving a body into space and then you are occupying that space. That's your diplacement. All movement that are not displacement are positioning. When displacement happens you probably need to do something.
