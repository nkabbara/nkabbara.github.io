Somewhere around the early 90s when we lived in Ghana, my dad drove me and my brothers to go play polo at The Shangri-La. He was playing a popular song by the Egyptian virtuoso Mohamed Abdel Wahab on the radio. My brothers with their mouths transformed into megaphones where blasting out the lyrics and humming the tune in full right-left stereo directly behind my head. Pulling that decades old image back into the present, I can see how the vibrations entered my brothers' ears and possessed them. They were not with us in the car, they where enraptured by the music and the singer. At 8 years old the lyrics would have made no sense to them, but that didn't matter. I remember my annoyance building up not only because of the loudness of the music, but also at how it bounced off my ears in painful deflections. It did not enter my body, instead it stopped at my ear drum and refused to take the journey into my soul. I turned around from the front seat to face my two brothers and screamed the following lyrics: "SHUT THE FUCK UP!". My dad disrupted the start of my ballad with "They are entraced by the music, don't break the spell." and flicked my head to make sure that his words entered deeper into my head beyond my eardrums. Fast forward to college to the time when we lived together in the same house. After watching The Visitor (2007), Richard Jenkins' character inspired me to pickup drumming. I bought a Djembe drum with the intention that some day soon I could join drum circles where I could freely drum my way into creating collabortive music. A few months into my training my brother's friend saw the drum in our living room and asked me to play something. I placed the drum between my legs and played a few beginner patterns that I had been practicing that week. When I finished he looked stright at me and said "Hm". Him and his wife exchanged glances and it looked as if he silently told her "What the fuck was that?" and her responding "It was creative for a door knock." He then asked my brother to give it a try and to our surprise he played some impressive beats that got us all moving in our seats. Jad had never touched a Djembe before in his life. His only training was going to the weekly social at a nighclub where an orchestra played his favorite music and few goblet drum lessons in his childhood. At that point I started to get the sense that maybe it took talent for someone be musical. That went against a fundamental belief of mine that one can get pretty far at anything they put their energy into so I dind't like how that thought made me feel. Fast forward to Buenos Aires where I'm at a milonga watching Porteños dance to songs that they had listened to since they were in their cirbs. Di Sarli was playing and an acquaintance of mine commented in my ear "I used to hate Di Sarli because my grandpa used to hit me with a cane during our tango lessons if I didn't step correctly to the orchestra's beat." I reacted with the appropriate facial expression, but deep down I wished that my grandpa too hit me with a cain when I misstepped to Di Sarli. What kind of dancer would I have become? Like Martìn probably. Like a dream.

At this stage of my tango, after overcoming a great deal of psychological barriers, I was
