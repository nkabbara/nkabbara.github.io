In my early teens when I lived in Ghana, my dad decided to take us to social club to spend a sunday there. He was playing a popular song by the Egyptian singer bla bla on the car's radio and my two brothers sitting in the back were outperforming the singer with their syncrhonized dubbing. The more they sang, the more infuriated I got until I turned back and screamed at them to shut the fuck up. My dad jumped to their defense and told they're matroobeen! Leave them alone. Fast forward to our young adulthood and when I decided to pickup the djembe. I took a few months of lessons and got good enough to play some basic tunes. One day, one of my brothers' friend asked me to play one for him and while I was doing so, one of my brothers picked it from me and started jamming freely tunes that were more complex and more exciting to hear. My brothers friend commented, wow, he's never taken a lesson and he plays better than you. Fuck them both. It was at that point when I realized that music doesn't come to me naturally. In fact, in fact, I could listen to a song more than a few hundred times and not be able to recite its lyrics nor its melody if you asked me to do so just one minute after listening to it. I will try and I will probably hum some other tune, but not the one. In double fact, I'm in my forties and I only have one song memorized because I actively memorized it. I spent hours writing done its lyrics in rote memorization and actively listening to it until I had it down. My brothers would be able to hum it only after a few listens. How is someone so musically challenged supposed to not only interpret the depth of tango music, but also gain enough technical mastery over it to express it not with his vocal chords only, but with his whole body? This one thing could be the thing that would finally make me give up tango because without the music there is no tango and if I'm genetically musically deaf then this thing ain't happening.

With my recent education on the difference between philosofising and doing, I decided to take a course in musicality but without my usual over analysis in my usual attempts at understanding it deeply before even starting to do apply. My deal with myself was, take the course start to finish and immediately go to the dance floor and make mistakes and look like an idiot as fast as possible. It was the perfect decision. The course made me aware of the basic elements of a tango song. Going to milongnas became more fun after that because I could see these elements in dancers. Before, I could tell who was dancing wel and who wasn't now I can tell who was dancing musically and who wasn't. Big difference. The best way to descrive this is to imagine a pianist tapping the keys with his legs instead of his hands. The dancer is basically doing that, but applying his own expressive patterns over the keys. But to make things more interesting the dancer could also choose the base to dance to. Now, you can imagin the bassist pulling the strings with his feet. As dancers we have this combanatorial possibilities fo picking any instrument we want, creatively dancing to it and also interpreting the conductors suggestions of what he wants us to do. We could even rebel and do the exact opposite of what the conductor wants us to do. Watching the dance floor, I could now detect who got it and how was marching to the timing of the music vs who was an instrument themselves. This was a whole new world that I didn't existed. My whole focus was on how to do a certain movement. This added a dimension that proved to be one of the most exciting.  I didn't want to do a phd in tango music to be able to dance like this so I went up to dancer that I found to be the most musical and asked him straight up how he learned to dance like that. He told me that he's a guitarist and later on discovered tango and made it his living. He taught classes and provided seceral services in the tango ecosystem. I decided to focus on that sub world of the rich musical world of tango.
