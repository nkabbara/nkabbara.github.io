My synchronized breath with my partner was the parking spot for my mind. However we are dancing we are not parked in a suburbian parking lot. If our common breath is the center then the first peripheral guest is the music. How can we invite the music, into this sacred place without it completely taking over the canvas of unity? Outside of the psychological challenges in the previous chapter this was the hardest challenge to overcome. Harder than technique itself.

At that point I had two good tools in my toolbox. I was already very comfortable with approaching problems from top down by breaking them down into subparts and going after them and I started becoming more comfortable with the bottom up approach of fucking up and then working on unfucking up until I got it. Musicality looked like something that would require both of these skills. In the planning room, I had to listen to a lot of tangos. I needed to focus on one orchestra at a time and start to absorb its patterns and arrangements. The first challenge here was that there was a plethora of bands to pick from. And I needed somewhere to start. So where to do so? In tango there are four bands known as the big four, so that helped narrow it down from 100 to four. Each of these bands had its own charactaristics and beauty and they suggested things differently. I didn't even have the vocabulary to describe nor study them. I put aside 45 minutes a day where I only listened to tango music actively. I picked one band from a certain year and I listened to them for one week each. This was planning Nash putting a plan together to do this. But wait, maybe that is not the right way to go about it?

What should I do about it? Hmm, let me talk to an expert and work with him. Let me talk to Martin and see how far I can take this.
