# Becoming Musical

<span class="new-sub-section">Somewhere around the mid 90s</span>, when we lived in Ghana, my dad drove us to go play polo at The Shangri-La. He was playing a popular song by the Egyptian virtuoso Mohamed Abdel Wahab on the radio of our 1990 Peugeot 505. My brothers, with their mouths transformed into megaphones, were blasting the lyrics and humming the tune in full stereo directly behind my head. Each had one of my ears all for themeselves. Pulling that decades old image back into the present, I could still see how the music entered their ears and possessed them. They were not with us in the car; they were transported by the music and the singer's voice to another place. At 8 years old the lyrics would have made no sense to them, but that didn't seem to matter. I remember my annoyance building up not only because of the loudness of that scene, but because the music did not mean much to me. It did not enter my body, instead it stopped at my ear drums and refused to take the journey into my soul. I turned around from the front seat to face the twins and screamed the following lyrics: "SHUT THE FUCK UP!" My dad disrupted the start of my ballad with "They are entranced by the music, don't break their spell." and flicked my head to make sure that his words entered deeper beyond my eardrums. Fast forward to college to the time when the three of us lived together. After watching The Visitor (2007), Richard Jenkins' character inspired me to pickup drumming. I bought a Djembe (West African drum) with the intention that some day soon I could join drum circles where I could freely drum my way into creating collabortive music. A few months into my training my brother's friend saw the drum in our living room and asked me to play something. I placed the drum between my legs and played a few patterns that I had been practicing that week. When I finished, he looked straight at me and said "Hm". Him and his wife exchanged glances and it looked as if he silently told her "What the fuck was that?" and her responding "It was creative. For a door knock." He then asked my brother to give it a try and to our surprise he played some impressive beats that got us all moving in our seats. Jad had never touched my Djembe before in his life. His only training was going to the weekly social at a nighclub where an orchestra played his favorite music. At that point I started to get the sense that maybe it took talent for someone to be musical. I didn't like how that thought made me feel because it went against a fundamental belief of mine that one can get pretty far at anything if they put their energy into it. Fast forward to Buenos Aires where I'm at a milonga watching Porteños dance to songs that they had been listening to since they were in their cribs. Di Sarli was playing and an acquaintance of mine commented in my ear "I used to hate Di Sarli because my grandpa hit me with a cane during our tango lessons if I didn't step correctly to the orchestra's beat." I reacted with the appropriate facial expression, but deep down I wished that my grandpa too forced me to dance to Di Sarli and hit me with a cane when I misstepped. What kind of dancer would I have become? Like Martìn probably. Elegant and free[^1].

[^1]: I'm romantasizing. I don't know what Martìn had to do in order to get over that trauma. It could have delayed him from becoming the dancer he was.

If I didn't have a musical ear and if musicality is the crucial ingredient that made a dancer a dancer, then what chance did I have at this project of mine? Had I overcome my psychological hurdles to face a genetic limitation? Should I have accepted this and stayed in tango at whatever capacity I had? I decided to ignore these questions and proceed as if musicality is something I could pick up. Though, deep down, I could feel a sliver of doubt. I sat at a milonga not dancing, just observing the most musical dancers. It was easy to spot them: I filtered out the couples that were distracted and the ones that were showing off and the ones that had ulterior motives. What was left were the couples that danced. What made them different than the others, I wondered. Instead of looking at their feet I started to look at their embraces. Then at their faces. Then epiphany. They had the same look on their faces that my brothers had more than twenty years ago in the backseat of the peauget 504. The leader and the follower shared a look of rapture. They were barely with us; just enough to avoid running into other dancers. Like Sufi dervishes they were not dancing to the music, rather they were being danced by the music.

I wanted to experiment with rapture myself and I wanted to try it immediately. At that time, I was reading Useful Not True, by Derek Sivers where he says "Your outside doesn't need to match your inside. You can feel terrified inside, but just pretend to be brave for one minute. By doing that, you were actually brave." That gave me the idea to fake a face of rapture while dancing for a whole night to see what came out of it. As soon I got into the embrace, I searched and sychronized with my partner's breath, as had become my habit, but added a fake face of rapture. I was imitating the faces of musical dancers that I had seen around the milonga. It was a combination of a slight smile with forrowing and relaxing the brow to the music. Forrow and smile more on the high beats and less on the low beats. Easy. The strange thing was it started to work. Faking a face of rapture actually put me in rapture. When I succeded at doing this for most of the tanda, I started to notice that more dancers hugged me an extra hug after we finished dancing. A gesture of thanks for showing them a good time. What's even stranger is that when I faked rapture the dance felt even better. Four songs passed in what felt like less than a minute. But I'm faking, how could this be? At that point, I understood and forgave every woman that faked an orgasim with me. I knew that I was onto something and I wanted to codify it into my tango ritual so I kept repeating this experiment to gain more insights. As I did so and I started to really get into rapture I realized that there was something more fundamental than music theory and musical expression at play. It was surrender. Faking rapture made me make contorted faces and made me alter my embrace and move my body contrary to what any teacher would have liked. It was the antithesis of precise technique and literal musical expression. To be danced by the music, you had to surrender. Surrender meant I'm OK with making mistakes and looking like I'm on LSD trip and boring my partner and making technical mistakes and boucing into people. And I'm also OK with impressing my partner and showing off my skill and respecting the dance floor code and flirting with them. Everything was on the table with surrender. When I've surreneded I noticed that being danced by the music was more available. Step 1 surrender, step 2, fake it until it happens. This was the precursor to technical musical expression and I had to get used to being in that state before I took classes in musicality.

Until then, I thought that to achieve unity, I had to synchronize my breath with my partner and keep my mind there. But it turned out that was just the doorway into Unity. I expanded my ritual to include surrender and defined surrender as everything is on the table. The mesmerizing, the good, the bad and the ugly.

                    TODO: add drawing
                    (surrender (synchronize breath))


Getting into this mystical state is no cart blanch. Without the right technique I risked going at it alone making Unity less stable. If I was going to enjoy my rapture it had to be shared and to do so I had to teach my body to express what's going into it through our four ears. Still I believed that learning to get into the mystical side of musicality is more interesting and if one had to choose that they should go for that. But it's like the difference between doing mushrooms and maintaining a daily practice in meditation. One blasts the nature of the universe down your brain for you to deal with the consequences while the another stablizes your mind over the course of a lifetime in a way that changes your relationship with the world and the people in it. Doing both will serve you the truth on different platters. Variety is a tonic.

I was excited. Now that I had figured out how to let the music take control of my body and my partner's body, I wanted it to do more with them. Looking at dancers express the music it was obvious that they were hearing things that I didn't notice. I wanted to figure out what those things were. I started scouting for teachers that had a focus on musicality and tried a few, but it was clear that they had holes in their methods. One teacher was big on theory. She explained every musical pattern that could take place and taught me how to express it with my hands. Take syncopations for example. She taught me how to anticipate them by clapping up in the air and then on my chest. But when it came time to actually lead them she couldn't take me far. Another teacher would dance syncopations in front of me and ask me to do the same. The issue was, that whatever pattern we picked (for the exception of the constant rhythmic base) they weren't repeated enough times for me to practice them. I wanted a teacher that understood rhytmically challenged ears and knew to reconstruct them into one that took audiary signals and converted by body into an expression of them.
