Somewhere around the early 90s when we lived in Ghana, my dad drove me and my brothers to go play polo at The Shangri-La. He was playing a popular song by the Egyptian virtuoso Mohamed Abdel Wahab on the radio. My brothers with their mouths transformed into megaphones where blasting out the lyrics and humming the tune in full right-left stereo directly behind my head. Pulling that decades old image back into the present, I can see how the vibrations entered my brothers' ears and possessed them. They were not with us in the car, they where enraptured by the music and the singer. At 8 years old the lyrics would have made no sense to them, but that didn't matter. I remember my annoyance building up not only because of the loudness of the music, but also at how it bounced off my ears in painful deflections. It did not enter my body, instead it stopped at my ear drum and refused to take the journey into my soul. I turned around from the front seat to face my two brothers and screamed the following lyrics: "SHUT THE FUCK UP!". My dad disrupted the start of my ballad with "They are entraced by the music, don't break the spell." and flicked my head to make sure that his words entered deeper into my head beyond my eardrums. Fast forward to college to the time when we lived together in the same house. After watching The Visitor (2007), Richard Jenkins' character inspired me to pickup drumming. I bought a Djembe drum with the intention that some day soon I could join drum circles where I could freely drum my way into creating collabortive music. A few months into my training my brother's friend saw the drum in our living room and asked me to play something. I placed the drum between my legs and played a few beginner patterns that I had been practicing that week. When I finished he looked stright at me and said "Hm". Him and his wife exchanged glances and it looked as if he silently told her "What the fuck was that?" and her responding "It was creative for a door knock." He then asked my brother to give it a try and to our surprise he played some impressive beats that got us all moving in our seats. Jad had never touched a Djembe before in his life. His only training was going to the weekly social at a nighclub where an orchestra played his favorite music and few goblet drum lessons in his childhood. At that point I started to get the sense that maybe it took talent for someone be musical. That went against a fundamental belief of mine that one can get pretty far at anything they put their energy into so I dind't like how that thought made me feel. Fast forward to Buenos Aires where I'm at a milonga watching Porteños dance to songs that they had listened to since they were in their cribs. Di Sarli was playing and an acquaintance of mine commented in my ear "I used to hate Di Sarli because my grandpa used to hit me with a cane during our tango lessons if I didn't step correctly to the orchestra's beat." I reacted with the appropriate facial expression, but deep down I wished that my grandpa too forced me to dance to Di Sarli and hit me with a cane when I misstepped. What kind of dancer would I have become? Like Martìn probably. Elegant and free.

If I didn't have a musical ear and if musicality is the crucial ingredient that made a dancer a dancer, then what chance did I have at this project of mine? Had I overcome my psychological hurdles to face a genetic limitation? Should I have accepted this and stayed in tango at whatever capacity I had? I decided to ignore these questions and proceed as if musicality is something I could pick up. Though, deep down, I could feel a sliver of doubt. I sat at a milonga not dancing, just observing people dance. I filtered out the couples that were distracted and the ones that were showing off and the ones that had ulterior motives. What was left were the couples that danced. What made them different than the others I wondered. Instead of looking at their feet I started to look at their embraces. Then at their faces. Then epiphany. They had the same look on their faces that my brothers had more than twenty years ago in the backseat of the peauget 504. The leader and the follower shared a look of rapture. They were barely with us; just enough to avoid running into other dancers. Like Sufi dervishes they were not dancing to the music, rather they were being danced by the music.

I wanted to experiment with rapture myself and I wanted to try it immediately (As I did these experiments bottom up, I could feel the bug named Nash's behavior change. He wasn't going to get a PhD in music before he dipped his hairy pads into rapture). What I did next I still laugh at myself for even attempting until this day. At that time, I was reading Useful Not True, by Derek Siver's where he says "Your outside doesn't need to match your inside. You can feel terrified inside, but just pretend to be brave for one minute. By doing that, you were actually brave." So I decided to fake a face of rapture while dancing for a whole night to see what came out of it. As soon I got into the embrace, I searched and sychronized with my partner's breath, but added a fake face of rapture to the mix. I picked out some of the dancers that I had seen the night before with that face and I immitated it. It was a combination of a constant smile with forrowing and relaxing the brow to the music. Forrow and smile more on the high beats and less on the low beats. Easy. The strange thing was it started to work. Faking a face of rapture actually put me in rapture. When I succeded at doing this for most of the tanda, I started to notice dancers hugging me an extra hug after we finished dancing. A gesture of thanks for showing them a good time. What's even stranger is that when I faked rapture the dance felt even better. Four songs passed in what felt like less than a minute. But I'm faking, how could this be? At that point, I understood and forgave every woman that faked an orgasim with me. I knew that I was onto something and I wanted to codify it into my tango ritual so I kept repeating this experiment to gain more insights. As I did so and I started to really get into rapture I realized that there was something more fundamental than music theory and musical expression at play. It was surrender. Faking rapture made me make contorted faces and made me alter my embrace and move my body contrary to what any teacher would have liked. It was the antithesis of precise technique and literal musical expression. To be danced by the music, you had to surrender. Surrender meant I'm OK with making mistakes and looking like I'm on LSD trip and boring my partner and making technical mistakes and boucing into people. And I'm also OK with impressing my partner and showing off my skill and respecting the dance floor code and flirting with them. Everything was on the table with surrender. When I've surreneded I noticed that being danced by the music was more available. Step 1 surrender, step 2, fake it until it happens. This was the precursor to technical musical expression and I had to get used to being in that state before I took classes in musicality.

Until then, I thought that to achieve unity, I had to synchronize my breath with my partner and keep my mind there. But it turned out that was just the doorway into Unity. I expanded my ritual to include surrender and defined surrender as everything is on the table. The mesmerizing, the good, the bad and the ugly.

                    (surrender (synchronize breath))


Getting into this mystical state is no cart blanch. Without the right technique I risked going at it alone making Unity less stable. If I was going to enjoy my rapture it had to be shared and to do so I had to teach my body to express what's going into it through our four ears. Still I believed that learning to get into the mystical side of musicality is more interesting and if one had to choose that they should go for that. But it's like the difference between doing mushrooms and maintaining a daily practice in meditation. One blasts the nature of the universe down your brain for you to deal with the consequences while the another stablizes your mind over the course of a lifetime in a way that changes your relationship with the world and the people in it. Doing both will serve you the truth on different platters. Variety is a tonic.

I was excited. Now that I had figured out how to let the music take control of my body and my partner's body, I wanted it to do more with them. Looking at dancers express the music it was obvious that they were hearing things that I didn't notice. I wanted to figure out what those things were. I started scouting for teachers that had a focus on musicality and tried a few, but it was clear that they had holes in their methods. One teacher was big on theory. She explained every musical pattern that could take place and taught me how to express it with my hands. Take syncopations for example. She taught me how to anticipate them by clapping up in the air and then on my chest. But when it came time to actually lead them she couldn't take me far. Another teacher would dance syncopations in front of me and ask me to do the same. The issue was, that whatever pattern we picked (for the exception of the constant rhythmic base) they weren't repeated enough times for me to practice them. I wanted a teacher that understood rhytmically challenged ears and knew to reconstruct them into one that took audiary signals and converted by body into an expression of them.
