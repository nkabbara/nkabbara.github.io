# Becoming Musical

<span class="new-sub-section">Somewhere around the mid 90s</span>, when we lived in Ghana, my dad drove us to go play polo at The Shangri-La, the trendiest country club of the time. He was playing a popular song by the Egyptian virtuoso Mohamed Abdel Wahab on the radio of our beat up 1990 Peugeot 505, the antithesis of what The Shagri-La represented. My brothers, with their mouths transformed into megaphones, were blasting the lyrics and humming the tune in full stereo directly behind my head. Each had one of my ears all for themeselves. Pulling that decades old image back into the present, I could still see how the music entered their ears and possessed them. They were not with us in the car; they were transported by the music and the singer's voice to another place. I remembered my annoyance building up because the music felt like a jackhammer pounding on the surface of my eardrums refusing to let it anywhere near my soul. I turned around from the front seat to face the twins and screamed the lyrics: "SHUT THE FUCK UP!" My dad then screamed at me "They are entranced by the music, don't break their spell." and flicked my head to make sure that his words entered deeper beyond my eardrums. About 10 years later when the three of us lived together in the same house, I started getting into independent movies and happened to watch The Visitor (2007). Richard Jenkins' character inspired me to pickup drumming. So I bought a Djembe (West African drum) with the intention that some day soon I could join drum circles where I could freely drum my way into creating collabortive music. A few months into my training my brother's friend saw the drum in our living room and asked me to play something. I placed the drum between my legs and played a few patterns that I had been practicing that week. When I finished, he looked straight at me and said "Hm". Him and his wife exchanged glances and it looked as if he silently told her "What the fuck was that?" and her responding "No clue." He then asked my brother to give it a try and to our surprise he played some impressive beats that got us all moving in our seats. Jad had never touched my Djembe before in his life. His only training was going to a nighclub on weekends where his favorite orchestra played. At that point I started to get the sense that maybe it took talent for someone to be musical. I didn't like how that thought made me feel because it went against a fundamental belief of mine that one can get pretty far at anything if they put their energy into it. About 10 years later when I moved to Buenos Aires I went to a milonga to watch Porteños dance to songs that they had been listening to since they were in their cribs. Di Sarli was playing and an acquaintance of mine commented in my ear "I used to hate Di Sarli because my grandpa hit me with a cane during our tango lessons if I didn't step correctly to the orchestra's beat." I reacted with the appropriate facial expression, but deep down I wished that my grandpa too forced me to dance to Di Sarli and hit me with a cane when I misstepped. What kind of dancer would I have become? Like Martìn probably. Elegant and free. But the reality was different. I struggled to let go and let the music in.


If I didn't have a musical ear and if musicality is the crucial ingredient that made a dancer a dancer, then what chance did I have at this project of mine? Had I overcome my psychological hurdles to face a genetic limitation? Should I have accepted this and stayed in tango without attempting to improve? I decided to ignore these questions and proceed as if musicality is something I could pick up. Though, deep down, I could feel a sliver of doubt. I sat at a milonga not dancing, just observing the most musical dancers. It was easy to spot them: I filtered out the couples that were distracted and the ones that were showing off. What was left were the couples that danced. What made them different than the others, I wondered. Instead of looking at their feet I started to look at their embraces. Then at their faces. They had the same look on their faces that my brothers had more than twenty years ago in the backseat of the peauget 504. The leader and the follower shared a look of rapture. They were barely with us; just enough to avoid running into other dancers. Like Sufi dervishes they were not dancing to the music, rather they were being danced by the music.

<span class="new-sub-section">I wanted to experiment with rapture</span> myself and I wanted to try it immediately. At that time, I was reading Useful Not True, by Derek Sivers where he says "Your outside doesn't need to match your inside. You can feel terrified inside, but just pretend to be brave for one minute. By doing that, you were actually brave. You might be a total introvert, but need to attend an event, so you act social for one hour. By pretending to be social, you were." That gave me the ridiculous idea of faking a face of rapture while dancing for a whole night to see what came out of it. As soon I got into the embrace, I performed my embrace ritual, as had become my habit, but added a fake face of rapture and lip-synced the music. I was imitating the faces of musical dancers that were around me. It was a combination of a slight smile with forrowing and relaxing the brow to the music: I forrowed and smiled more on the high beats and less on the low beats and proceeded to dance as I usually did. The strange thing was that it started to work. Faking a face of rapture actually put me in rapture. When I succeded at doing this for most of the tanda, I started to notice that some dancers hugged me an extra hug after we finished dancing. A gesture of thanks for showing them a good time. What's even stranger is that when I faked rapture the dance felt better. Four songs passed in what felt like less than a minute. But I'm faking, how could this be? (At that point, I started to understand why women faked orgasims and I stopped getting annoyed by it). I knew that I was onto something and I wanted to understand it so it's part of my tango. Several weeks into fake rapture and what I came to realize was that my contorted face was telling the music that it had permission to do whatever it wanted with me. Contorting my face was only one of those things. It had permission to make technical mistakes with my body. It had permission to bore me and my partner. It had permission to bounce me into other couples. But it also had permission to show itself off through me, to delight my partner and to perform for the folks looking at us. To be danced by the music, I had to surrender. I experimented actively with surrender by pledging to do it after I've connected with my partner's embrace and as I did so rapture started to happen without me having to fake it. I would get into the embrace perform my rituals and then I would make a pledge to surrender.

As fullfilling as it felt, I knew that getting into that semi mystical state was not enough. Without the right musical technique I was risking subduing a basic element of dance which is to play. If I was going to enjoy my rapture with my partner, play had to be at the center of it.

<span class="new-sub-section">Up until that point, my education in tango had been didactic in nature:</span> Here's a move, here's how you do it, now go do it. I had built a repertoire of these moves as I progressed and they had become automatic. Sometimes they fit in with the music, other times they didn't, but I used them regardless rendering my dance non-musical at times. I needed to do one of the hardest things one has to do in their journey of growth and that is to unlearn what they already know. Unlearning sounds strange. It sounds like you have a delete button and you could remove nuerons around specific connection in your brain. But that is not how it works in dance. I sought the help of a dance teacher that is well versed in biomechanics and he taught me that in order to unlearn, you must first deconstruct. It basically came down to finding moments of calm within the movements that you already know. He said "If your calsified pattern is made up of multiple parts, then find the connection points between those parts and pause in those moments". He then asked me to lead him while performing what he just explained. As I started to pause, he stopped me and said "You are imitating the form of a pause, but you are not actually pausing. A pause is not a suspension of muscles in the air or holding a specific pattern. Rather, it's transmitting less information."


I started to do that, but then he caught me faking. He said to me that what I was doing was imitating a pause, but while doing so, I was still tense and projecting a lot of information, what I needed to do was give off less information. I needed to truly turn the equipment generating movement down enough to give space to the environament to come in because if i'm constantly on a hight modulation, nothing will ever come in so every one of my movements, had to to consist of down times. Having learned this, I took my basic elements that I use all the time and I started to work on deconstructing them. I started to see where can I find pauses in those movments without even thinking about what I would do in those pauses. I would leave that to the gods of creativity to come in and make suggestions. This started to make my dance feel much more enjoyable. There were these moments of pausing sprinkled everywhere and these were the moments of where true creativity could show its face.
