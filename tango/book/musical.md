What does it mean to be musical? At it's essence it;s watching someone step on some kind of musical element. This could be on the marcato in two or marcato in three or it could be a musical bridge or it could be an adornment. Whatever it is, it is a physical expression of what you're you're you're you're hearing in your body so the other person you're dancing with feels like you're playing. The last thing your partner wants to feel is like you're tyinking. As long as you're playing all is good and to be able to play with the music is to let it command you. There;s a subtle difference between dancing to the music or being danced by the music, One is violant and thoughful and exacting while the other is flowy and more connected with the vibrations. And the complexity of the music lends itself to allow you to pick and choose from a variety of layers in how to and what to express.

My question to myself was, is it possible for me to become musical? If the answer to that question was a no, then I had no choice but to quit tango. There is not tango dance without tango music so naturally you cannot stay at it if you lack that fundemental trait. Well, putting my loss aversion syndrome to full use, since I had already invested so much of my time in tango was to try and see how far I can stretch my musicality.

Just like technique in tango, everyone will teach you musicality in their own way. There is no ordained system in place that translate musical concepts to non musicians in a standardized method. This meant that I had to go on a wild gooze chase to find a teacher that one, knew the theory well enough so he could do the conversion for me. Two, that knew how to teach. Three, that I got along with him. On top of that, I had to put in a ton of work myself to train my ears to listen to the music properly. Where do I even begin? I asked my teacher that is technique focused about that and I could tell that she didn't know how to teach it. She wrote some theory for me on a napkin and told me that I had to step on these markings and not those. Another teacher was more helpul, he asked me to listen to a song closely and identify its elements and its phrases and also demoed it to me in a dance so I could start by copying him. That seemed to be ok, but also felt a bit patched together. Until I ran into a teacher that seemed to have a deeper grasp of what's going on. His excercises and his way of teaching break down the steps into their elements. He broke down the didactick method of performing steps and associated it with the music.

I wanted to hire him as my teacher, but I was already committed to mine and I felt this social pressure of not wanting to fire a teacher and run to the other. Though mine was a bit lacking in technique I still felt this pressure. How could I break that relationsip gracefully while still maintaining a certain friendship? Should I keep him as my teacher but less regularly and switch between the new one and the other? Breaking relationships is whatever capacity and maintaining some sort of friendliness is a useful lifeskill. How to do so with this guy?

But wait. I don't even know if the other guy i good? How to find out? Easy. Do a couple of classes with him and get an idea of how it goes. From there, decide what to do next.
