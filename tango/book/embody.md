# Embodying a Dancer

<span class="new-sub-section">What do dancers do? They dance.</span>

What have I been doing for the majority of my tango time? I was stuck in learning mode. I wanted to be so good that when I went out there I could immediately impress (not necessarily others as much as myself). However, what I found out was that going into someone's embrace and being my true self comfortably is its own kind of practice. I needed to be in enough embraces and feel vulnerable enough times until I could understand what it meant to be at ease in my own skin.

I invented elaborate learning systems that were going to make me ready for social dancing. Unbeknowst to me at the time, these were fear avoidance strategies camouflaged as necessary prerequisites to dancing. I went into them with an assumption that they would take a long time to complete because dance is a skill that required mastery and mastery takes a lifetime. What a comforting feeling it must have been for my subconcious to know that it will never have to face the inevitable. This artifivial barrier became clear to me when I heard a talk by Oliver Burkeman, author of Four Thousand Weeks address this directly. Burkeman says that the reason that habit building or elaborate learning systems get in our way is because the change weâ€™re contemplating is actually rather scary or uncomfortable and treating it as a long-term incremental project is a convenient way to push the difficult stuff to another time. For example, maybe I just needed to go out there and dance with other people and make mistakes and look stupid and be OK with it. Instead, I just did what I was comfortable with. Here's an example of my learning plan at the time: The first part was weekly private lessons with an experienced teacher. The second part was group classes where I could reinforce my private lessons and expose myself to new teachers. The third was private practice with friends. The last part was going to milongas to apply all my learnings. I was thinking of milongas as spaces where I could apply my learnings not spaces where I could dance to express myself and connect. I didn't give myself the space nor the time to do what this whole thing was about. My private practice with friends was my favorite part of my program, but it had the feeling of being stuck in middle school forever. I started to noticed that we compensated for each other's weaknesses and things that worked in private didn't necessarily transfer to the dance floor. A big part of tango is being able to go up to a new person and within the first minute be able to negotiate a whole world of movement and sensation then enjoy our agreement for the rest of the tanda. Practicing with friends doesn't teach you that. The group classes and private lessons though they were beneficial, they lacked an important inquiry due to their self serving bias: are you going out there and dancing? In hindsight, I think every teacher should stop giving lessons after around two months of instruction until students can say that they had overcome their dance floor anxieties. Only on rare occasions did teachers ask me how my social dancing was going. My system also served as my safe place where I reverted whenever I felt inadequate. Whenever I hit some set back on the dance floor, instead of addressing it on the dance floor, I came back to my system and modified it in some way that would supposedly prevent a setback like that from happening again. Going to classes was a necessary part of growing as a dancer, but I was using it to keep me away from the dance floor.


One night, I sat out a whole milonga without asking for any dances from anyone. It felt like there was an almost palpable entity inside me preventing me from asking for dances. I got so upset that I decided that if I don't figure out how to ask for dances and enjoy them, I was going to quit tango and pickup an easier hobby like woodcarving. I was back face to face with the fear of rejection and there was no way around it, I had to face it in order to embody my new identity. As I dug deeper into the composition of my fear of rejection I realized that it wasn't rejection that I was afraid of. It was acceptance. I was afraid of dancers accepting my invite, but I was using rejection as an excuse to keep me seated. Here's what it means in tango when someone says yes to your invite: your first responsibility is protecting your partner from other dancers that could be bouncing into you from all directions. In milongas there's always a mix of beginners that don't know how to navigate the floor with experienced dancers that know how to navigate, but don't respect the code with others that just happened to be where you wanted to go. There's also the embrace. It's a subtle act of balance: I cannot embrace her too tightly or she'll be uncomfortable, too loosely and she'll be lost. I must embrace her within the goldylocks range where I have clear demarcated boundaries that communicate the notion of don't worry, there's someone in charge at the helm, but also of the tenderness of holding a baby. I will have to maintain this embrace and multiple variations of it (because it's different for every partner I dance with) throughout the tanda. Add to the body guard role and the delicate embrace the rich and deep world of tango music. A genre so deep that it stands on its own without the dance. If I were to follow the advice of good dancers, I would have to somehow magically convert my body to a musical instruments and express myself through it. I need to transmit this musicality to my partner in a way that she could understand it or we'll be stepping on each other's feet. These are just a few of the expected responsibilities a leader must assume. I also had my own set of expectations that fall into two buckets. The first was mostly about impressing others. The second was about making my crushes fall in love with me. I added to these all the subconcious muck that I'm not even aware of and reached the conclusion that I was afraid of the responsibility, not the rejection.

In his book, Useful Not True, Derek Sivers says that you don't have to feel like someone to be that someone. Your self-image doesn't matter that much as long as you are taking action. You are your actions. Your actions are you. You can feel terrified inside, but just pretend to be brave for one minute. By doing that, you were actually brave. After my enlightenment, I felt the palpable entity that sat in my chest and caused my inhibition disappear. I believe that was because my mind knew that it could handle responsibility and once it became aware that that was the cause of my inhibition, it let go[^1]. Since that point on I barely sat at milongas. Whenver I arrived at one, I looked for someone that I felt like I would like to dance with and went straight for them. If I didn't find someone specific, I asked people from the nearest table and then the next until I had my fill for the night. In some dances I felt anxious, in others I felt flow and in others I felt joy. It didn't matter. I was dancing and I was finally starting to feel like a dancer.

[^1]: after this experience, I'm convinced that once the mind understands and is clearly aware of the cause of its inhibition, then it can start moving forward. In moving forward, there will be fear and other emotional and mental challenges, but it won't be inhibition. So if you feel inhibited, look for what's blocking you and understand it. It will resolve itself and you'll start moving forward.

But what about rejection? As I danced with more people I started to get at least one rejection on any given day. Suprisingly, it had a negligible effect on me. It was like asking someone 'is this the line for the icecream?' and them saying 'no, this is the line for chocolate, icecream is over there' and I simply proceeded to get my icecream. I was embarrased at how insignificant it felt because a short time ago it immobilized me in my seat for hours.

Suddenly becoming comfortable at milongas felt like I had awoken from a multi-year slumber. Still a little groggy, but excited to make up for lost time. I decided to start journaling about every milonga I went to to capture where my mind and my heart were going. It was like trying to understand a bug by studying it under a magnifying glass. I called this era of my development A Bug Named Nash. It resulted in the biggest breakthroughs I had in years.

In the first period in of the Bug era, the Post Slumber Period, I became aware that my mind constantly went to several places. The first one was figuring out what the next step was going to be. As I was in the middle of a movement, my mind was adamant on figuring what it was I was going to do next: "This is the perfect moment for a parallel turn.", "I should do some more ochos here", "I want to practice right turns here, focus on technique here". I was anxious about not boring my partner, so I was constantly in a search for the next thing to come.
