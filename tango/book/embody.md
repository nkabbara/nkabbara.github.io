# Embodying a Dancer

What does a dancer do? He dances.

Yes, there is learning, testing new things, practicing solo, practing with friends, taking private classes, taking group classes, watching experts perform, but compared to dancing these things are secondary. In my since I started tango, I had been devoting all my time to everything, but the most important: dancing.

One night I went to a milonga and sat the whole thing through without dancing not even one tanda. I got so upset at myself that that I went back home in an internal rage promising myself that if I don't crack this challenge then I'm going to give up on tango. I'll just make it a sideline hobby forgetting it as my artistic expression. I thought I'd take up wood carving instead and shelve my shoes into storage.

[Here interview three people about how they slowly built up the courage to start dancing.]

What was it that kept me in hiding? Was it that I lacked courage to go up and ask for dances? Was it laziness? Was it that I didn't truly enjoy the dance and just in love with the idea of it? I noticed that I tended to wait for people to ask me to dance instead of going out and seeking dances. If someone asked to dance well, they got what they asked for. But if I asked someone to dance, I expted myself to give them a good time and make them enjoy themselves. I didn't feel like I could take on that responsibility. There was too much to worry about while dancing, there was technique, there was the steps, there was musicality, there was floor craft, there was showmenship, there was protecting my partner from instrusive dancers, there was giving her a good time, there was the fear of not hurting her by stepping on her or running her into a table, there was my teacher watching me and me hearing his comments during our upcoming class. I had to ask someone up for a dance and manage all these things. No wonder why I preferred to sit and wait for someone to ask me to dance. My fear of rejection that I thought was the source of my not-dancing-enough dilema was negligible compare to how I looked at my responsibility towards my partner. I cared. And I was terrified. It wasn't the asking her and her rejecting me that was scaring. I was actually scared of her saying yes, she would like to dance with me.

In order to build up my confidence, I started the 100 new dances challenge. My goal was to dance with 100 new dancers in a relatively short amount of time and documenting each experience. This should be much easier for me now since I figuered out how to stay longer at milongas without freaking out. I thought with that list in place, my mind would have a document to refer to whenever it felt a pinge of insecurity take over. Here's a sample of how my journal looked like:

[Your reserach is to get 100 dances with new people as fast as possible and your writing task is documenting each dance. Start today. List them here daily. We could finish this by end of July. We can clean the above text up as we go]

## Ideas

* Your worth at milongas changes because you feel like people evaluate you on how you dance, not on who you are or how you are as a person.
* Is there room for 'a mantra to get into the music zone?'
* Are you a frog or a horse: use analogies of types of people and how to break them in. Boling frogs (gradual or immidiate like breaking in a horse). Study the sources of these to see how you can work them in at some point into this chapter.
* Remember that eventually we need to revisit rejection in this chapter and how we got over it by embodying the identity of a dancer.
> It's not about how well you play, it's how you feel about what you play.
* In his book, Useful Not True, Derek Sivers says that you don't have to feel like someone to be that someone.

> Your outside doesn't need to match your inside.
> You can feel terrified inside, but just pretend to be brave for one minute. By doing that, you were actually brave.
> You are your actions. Your actions are you. Your self-image doesn't matter as much.
> When you realize what you need to do, it doesn't mean that's who you need to be. You can just pretend.
