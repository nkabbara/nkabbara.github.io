# Embodying a Dancer

<span class="new-sub-section">What do dancers do? They dance.</span>

What have I been doing for the majority of my tango time? I was stuck in learning mode. I wanted to be so good that when I went out there I could immediately impress (not necessarily others as much as myself). However, what I found out was that going into someone's embrace and being my true self comfortably is its own kind of practice. I needed to be in enough embraces and feel vulnerable enough times until I could understand what it meant to be at ease in my own skin.

These elaborate learning systems that were supposedly making me ready for social dancing were fear avoidance strategies devised by my brain as useful endeavors. I went into them with an assumption that they would take a long time to complete because dance is a skill that required mastery and mastery takes a lifetime. So in addition to artificially creating a barrier between me and what I was afraid of, I also succeded in sucking the fun out of dancing. All this became clear to me when I heard a talk by Oliver Burkeman, author of Four Thousand Weeks address this directly. Burkeman says that the reason that habit building or self improvement systems get in our way is because the change we’re contemplating is actually rather scary or uncomfortable and treating it as a long-term incremental project of habit building is a convenient way to push the difficult stuff to another time. So for example, maybe I just needed to go out there and dance with other people with whatever skill I had at the time. With people that had their own set of insecurities and mix mine with theirs and learn how to enjoy this cocktail of human insecurities until after having a few we start to connect on a basic level of human coordiantion. This is not to say that going to classes was bad. No, it was a necessary part of growing as a r

> I think we’re craving, whenever we use habit formation in [avoidant ways], that is in a way that results in us not doing the things in question, is our old friend the feeling of control. We want above all feeling in control of our lives. We want to see ourselves as the captain of the super yacht of our lives standing confidently on the bridge steering our life towards the future pointer which we will finally feel adequate and on top of things. Devising schemes for self improvement can really feed into that fantasy because you get to mentally project into the future all details all the nuts and bolts of how you’re going to get to that perfect future place. Where by contrast when you just do something today as a one off, [imperfectly and] with no promises about the future; when you just write a few paragraphs of your novel or sit and meditate for one session or suggest one meet up with a friend or go for one run, that requires the surrender of control because that’s not about steering the super yacht. That’s about launching your little canoe directly onto the rapids of reality and letting life take you wherever it’s going to take you. It means risking that you might do the thing badly and certainly that you’ll do it imperfectly. It means being OK with the possibility that you might sit down and meditate today or go for a run today or reach out to a friend today and then not come back to doing it again tomorrow.

I was deep into avoidant learning and my latest system was proof of that. The first part was weekly private lessons with an experienced dancer and teacher. The second part was group classes where I could reenforce my private lessons and expose myself to different teachers. The third part was private practice with friends. The last part was going to milongas to apply all my learnings. I was thinking of socials as spaces where I could apply my learnings not spaces where I could dance and have fun. I didn't give myself the space to do what this whole thing was about. My thinking was fundemantally flawed because dancing to have fun should have been the driving force behind everything else. Seeing someone execute a movement that looks awe inspiring should have been the impetus to drive me to the class room in order to learn how to do it with my own body. Not an abstract idea of a good dancer that I was abstractly preparing to be. Up until that point private practice with my friends was the highlight of my tango activities. We were learning from each other and having a lot of fun, but it had the feeling of being stuck in middle school forever. I started to noticed that we compensated for each other weaknesses and things that worked with each other didn't necessarily transfer to other dancers. With my private teacher I worked hard on improving my technique and she had a lifetime of improvements in store for me. She was cheering my multiyear plan and in support of it, but she wasn't aware that my fundemantal weakness was not lack of technique, but lack dancing. I was happily applying my improved techniques with her, with my friends and with Bruja (I took the sticks out of two brooms to stand in for my imaginary partner's legs. I named her Bruja.) in my living room, but not with social dancers. My progress was slowing down because in between the classes I didn't have enough dances to be able to test things out and come back with feedback. Group classes were educational, but I started to lean on them more as social interactions and to make friends. I tended to get closer with people that had the same behavior which meant we weren't there for the dance itself as much as for the growth of it. We were there for fun. I  later realized that when I started to improve beyound my social circle's capabilities. I loved my friends, therefore I wanted to have more fun with them and sometimes I couldn't.

One night, I sat out a whole milonga without asking for any dances from anyone. It felt like there was an almost touchable block preventing me from asking for dances. I got so upset that I decided that if I don't figure this out, I was going to quit tango and pickup an easier hobby like woodcarving. I was back face to face with the fear of rejection. There was no way around it, I had to face it in order to embody my new identity. As I dug deeper into the composition of my fear of rejection I realized that it wasn't rejection that I was afraid of. It was acceptance. I was afraid of dancers accepting my invite, but I was using rejection as an excuse to keep me seated. Here's what it means in tango when someone says yes to your invite: your first responsibility is protecting your partner from other dancers that could be bouncing into you from all directions. In milongas there's always a mix of beginners that don't know how to navigate the floor with experienced dancers that know how to navigate, but don't respect the code with good dancers that just happened to be where you wanted to go. You must do whatever you can to protect your partners dress from being ripped apart from someone elseds high heels. Or second most important, avoid her from getting a bruise. I must also reciprocate the good manners of dancers around me and not bounce into them. The embrace I offer to my partner is a subtle act of balance. I cannot embrace her too tightly or she'll be uncomfortable, too loosely and she'll be lost. I must embrace her withing the goldylocks spectrum where she knows what I'm proposing for her to do and she's comfortable and she feels all the past pain joy my heart has ever experienced. She could refuse the embrace that I offer her and suggest a different version to which I must adapt immediately still offering all these perks. Within the song or even tanda, I must maintain the spirit of the embrace that we settled on or the dance will feel imbalanced. I must convert my body into a musical instrumant and make it part of the orchestra that's being played. My tone must change with the changes in the song a song that changes every 30 seconds or so. If I don't do that then I might as well get high on extacy (and spike my partner's drink with some) and bounce my hand monotonically in a rave. But no, I must drug her the natural and hard way. And do all these things while giving myself and my partner a good time. I was afraid of the responsibility not of the rejection. Her saying now was actually what I wanted! No wonder I was comfortable when someone asked me to dance because that felt like it was their own choice. Like if any of thesethings above were not to work out, it's on them because I didn't take the responsibility of asking them. They must deal with their own consequences.

After reaching that epiphany, it felt like something inside me flipped. That block that kept me in my seat disappeared. I suddenly barely sat at milongas. Whenver I arrived at one, I looked for someone that I felt like I would like to dance with and went straight for them. If I didn't find someone specific, I started from table number 1 until the last table. Asking for more dances meant more chances for rejections and rejections happened, but also surpirsingly they had a negligible effect on me. It was like asking someone 'is this the line for the icecream?' and them saying 'no, this is the line for chocolate, icecream is over there' and I simply proceeded to find the line for icecream. It still baffles me how much imaginary fear my mind instilled in me for doing what I do now lightly. I think that when I realized that anxiety of taking responsibility was what was keeping in my seat, my fear disappeared because I have owned to many bigger and more serious responsibilities in my life. I just didn't know what I was dealing with.

Once I got unblocked and started to dance all night, I started to get the feeling that after years of taking lessons and practiving with my broom, that now I was actually starting to dance and that dancing with so many people should have been the firt thing to do. My teachers should have refused to give me any lessons beyond the first couple of months until I overcame what I overcame years later. Dancing with so many different people with different body types, moods, and energies is its own sub discipline and requires its own progression. It feeds right back into lessons and practice and it is what allows you to actually improve. It is the magical ingridient that allows you to find yourself as a dancer. In order to make up for lost time, I decided to start journaling about every milonga I went to. It was like studying a bug with a magnifying glass to understand its patterns of behavior. I called this era of my development A Bug Named Nash. It was the biggest breakthrough I had in years.

_from here on we could divide the sections by Bug Named Nash sub periods_

---

In the first period in of the Bug era, I became aware that my mind constantly went to several places. The first one was figuring out what the next step was going to be. As I was in the middle of a movement, my mind was adamant on figuring what it was I was going to do next: "This is the perfect moment for a parallel turn.", "I should do some more ochos here", "I want to practice right turns here, focus on technique here". I was anxious about not boring my partner, so I was constantly in a search for the next thing to come.

## Ideas

* Permanent student
* Your worth at milongas changes because you feel like people evaluate you on how you dance, not on who you are or how you are as a person.
* a mantra to get into the music zone. How to stop learning mode and practice mode and actually dance.
* Are you a frog or a horse: use analogies of types of people and how to break them in. Boling frogs (gradual or immidiate like breaking in a horse). Study the sources of these to see how you can work them in at some point into this chapter.
* Remember that eventually we need to revisit rejection in this chapter and how we got over it by embodying the identity of a dancer.
> It's not about how well you play, it's how you feel about what you play.
* In his book, Useful Not True, Derek Sivers says that you don't have to feel like someone to be that someone.
> Your outside doesn't need to match your inside.
> You can feel terrified inside, but just pretend to be brave for one minute. By doing that, you were actually brave.
> You are your actions. Your actions are you. Your self-image doesn't matter as much.
> When you realize what you need to do, it doesn't mean that's who you need to be. You can just pretend.
* There is acting in dancing, but you don't just simply pick a character. You need to dance at least 100 dances to discover who it is you really can be.
* What you remember is not the steps you made or the mistakes you made. You remember how it felt. So we are looking for connection in a milonga, the sacred place.
* Find the oomph in your dance. Nothing is passive. When in embrace everything is active.
