# Embodying a Dancer

What do dancers do? They dance.

What have I been doing for the majority of my tango time? I was stuck in learning mode for years. At first I was waiting to be ready, to feel ready so I could go out to the dance floor and just be great. I didn't want to be upcloe and vulnerable. I wanted to study really really hard then go show what I'm made of. However, what I came to find out that going into someone's embrace and being your true honest self comfortably is its own kind of practice. I needed to be in enough embraces and feel vulnerable enough times, until I could truly express myself.

Going to the dance floor with a mindset of discovery and a stronger presence to monitor what I was doing and how I was feeling was one of the biggest breakthroughs I had in years. It was like studying a bug with a magnifying glass to understand its patterns of behavior. I called this period of my development Bug Named Nash.

I started with the easy things first. I designated three days a week as a minimum to go to dances. At those dances, I pleged to sit front and center to make it easy for me to ask for dances. Right at settling down, I monitored how people were asking each other for dances and mimic's them. I prioritized dancers that never danced with before and if brain had designated them as intimidating the better. That would probably generate more behavior from the Bug. I was doing that in the name of science. The science of self discovery. After each milonga I wrote down how I felt with each dancer and took some general notes in regards to the evening.

## Ideas

* Permanent student
* Your worth at milongas changes because you feel like people evaluate you on how you dance, not on who you are or how you are as a person.
* a mantra to get into the music zone. How to stop learning mode and practice mode and actually dance.
* Are you a frog or a horse: use analogies of types of people and how to break them in. Boling frogs (gradual or immidiate like breaking in a horse). Study the sources of these to see how you can work them in at some point into this chapter.
* Remember that eventually we need to revisit rejection in this chapter and how we got over it by embodying the identity of a dancer.
> It's not about how well you play, it's how you feel about what you play.
* In his book, Useful Not True, Derek Sivers says that you don't have to feel like someone to be that someone.
> Your outside doesn't need to match your inside.
> You can feel terrified inside, but just pretend to be brave for one minute. By doing that, you were actually brave.
> You are your actions. Your actions are you. Your self-image doesn't matter as much.
> When you realize what you need to do, it doesn't mean that's who you need to be. You can just pretend.
* There is acting in dancing, but you don't just simply pick a character. You need to dance at least 100 dances to discover who it is you really can be.
* What you remember is not the steps you made or the mistakes you made. You remember how it felt. So we are looking for connection in a milonga, the sacred place.
* Find the oomph in your dance. Nothing is passive. When in embrace everything is active.
