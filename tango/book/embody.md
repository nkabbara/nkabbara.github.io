# Embodying a Dancer

<span class="new-sub-section">In his book, Useful Not True</span>, Derek Sivers says that you don't have to feel like someone to be that someone.

> Your outside doesn't need to match your inside.
> You can feel terrified inside, but just pretend to be brave for one minute. By doing that, you were actually brave.

Does this mean that to be a dancer, I just had to pretend that I am one and eventually I will become one?

> You are your actions. Your actions are you. Your self-image doesn't matter as much.

> When you realize what you need to do, it doesn't mean that's who you need to be. You can just pretend.

> You can imitate your role model. Many top performers have an alter ego — a Jekyll to their Hyude or vice-versa — a side of themselves they personify and bring out when needed. It's not Maria who negotiates. It's El Tigre.

When I read that I realized that I had an imminant task ahead. It's not Nash that dancers. It's _____. Who's going to be my alter ego?

Structure
1. Derek's advice
2. I started to search for a role model and found one that flipped my weakneses. Found him. List his story and why he's awesome. Describe how he flipps your weaknesses.
3. I didn't want to use him because he made me feel unformfortable. I felt more comfortable with a perfect technician. I wanted one that is harder to follow, but put me in my comfort zone. Pull in oliver burkman here.
4. Describe how I'm feeling when dancing as him.

## Ideas

* Are you a frog or a horse: use analogies of types of people and how to break them in. Boling frogs (gradual or immidiate like breaking in a horse). Study the sources of these to see how you can work them in at some point into this chapter.
* Remember that eventually we need to revisit rejection in this chapter and how we got over it by embodying the identity of a dancer.
