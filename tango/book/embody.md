# Embodying a Dancer

<span class="new-sub-section">In his book, Useful Not True</span>, Derek Sivers says that you don't have to feel like someone to be that someone.

> Your outside doesn't need to match your inside.
> You can feel terrified inside, but just pretend to be brave for one minute. By doing that, you were actually brave.

Does this mean that to be a dancer, I just had to pretend that I am one and eventually I will become one?

> You are your actions. Your actions are you. Your self-image doesn't matter as much.

> When you realize what you need to do, it doesn't mean that's who you need to be. You can just pretend.

> You can imitate your role model. Many top performers have an alter ego — a Jekyll to their Hyude or vice-versa — a side of themselves they personify and bring out when needed. It's not Maria who negotiates. It's El Tigre.

When I read that I realized that I had an imminant task ahead. It's not Nash that dancers. It's _____. Who's going to be my alter ego?

What I did know for a fact was that without embodying an identity, I tended to get a few recurring pieces of feedback from teachers and from dancers alike. The first one was "tell her, don't ask her". There's a subtle energy when leading a movement where one can be in asking mode or in telling mode. It's so suble that if I wanted to change my "asking" to "telling" by exerting more force then I'd completely spill into the universes of "don't push her, lead her" and "don't mover her around like rag doll". What could alter this is a shift in attitude: a shift from "please, excuse me, would you please move to the left so I can step forward" to "sweetheart, materialize my lead into a step." My alter ego had to have that attitude. Another feedback I kept getting was "I can't feel your hand on my back." I placed my hand so softly on my followers back that they couldn't feel it. The subtlety with this one is that pulling her body into too much would mess up her axis. So the embrace had to somehow feel firm, yet giving. And the final piece of advice is "don't walk on water, push the ground". Pushing the ground. No matter how much I tried to crack that nut, the end result was so weird I felt like trex walking. My alter ego had to feel the ground and use it to propell his body.

Who can tell a woman to do what he wants and expects her to? Who can embrace a woman so fully that she can feel every part of his arm? Who can walk and feel like they're rotating the earth beneath them?

## Ideas

* Are you a frog or a horse: use analogies of types of people and how to break them in. Boling frogs (gradual or immidiate like breaking in a horse). Study the sources of these to see how you can work them in at some point into this chapter.
* Remember that eventually we need to revisit rejection in this chapter and how we got over it by embodying the identity of a dancer.
