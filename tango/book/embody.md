# Embodying a Dancer

What does a dancer do? He dances.

Yes, there is learning, testing new things, practicing solo, practing with friends, taking private classes, taking group classes, watching experts perform, but compared to dancing these things are secondary. In my since I started tango, I had been devoting all my time to everything, but the most important: dancing.

One night I went to a milonga and sat the whole thing through without dancing not even one tanda. I got so upset at myself that (interview everyone you know that dances well about how they broke through) that I went back home in an internal rage promising myself that if I don't crack this challenge then I'm going to give up on tango. I'll just make it a sideline hobby forgetting it as my artistic expression. I thought I'd take up wood carving instead and shelve my shoes into storage.

I put myself under a microscope and my behavior felt self entitled. My default behavior was to dance only when someone comes and asks me to. I rarely ever go around asking folks for dances unless I put in immense psychological effort to do so. That needed to change and change quick otherwise I was going to quit. I was face to face with the thing that I had been avoiding for years. Everywhere I lived tango
sucked. Milongas had less than 20 people, mostly into cliques and fractured groups. The good dancers were few and the attractice ones rare. My excuse there was that there was not motivation to go and apply what I'm learning at socials. But that was an excuse. The real reason was something deeper. I lived in a city where I became friends with a championship contender. She was giving me all the signs that she would dance with me if I worked hard to reach her level. Thought he community sucked there, I had a championship level dancer willing to put in time with me and get me up there. I lost the chance. Why? I'm started to get the answer to that in Buenos Aires where tango excuses don't exist. There I was, in the Disney Land of tango and I was still not dancing. There were countless good dancers and beautiful women always ready to dance, but I still behaved the same way as I did.

What was it that kept me in hiding? Was it that I lacked courage to go up and ask for dances? Was it laziness? Was it that I didn't truly enjoy the dance and just in love with the idea of it? The truth was much simpler and much sadder. I had a sense of entitlement combined with insecurity. If someone asked to dance well, they got what they asked for. But if I asked someone to dance, I expted myself to give them a good time and make them enjoy themselves. I didn't feel like I could take on that responsibility. There was too much to worry about while dancing, there was technique, there was the steps, there was musicality, there was floor craft, there was showmenship, there was protecting my partner from instrusive dancers, there was giving her a good time, there was the fear of not hurting her by stepping on her or running her into a table, there was my teacher watching me and me hearing his comments during our upcoming class. I had to ask someone up for a dance and manage all these things. No wonder why I preferred to sit and wait for someone to ask me to dance. My fear of rejection that I thought was the source of my not-dancing-enough dilema was negligible compare to how I looked at my responsibility towards my partner. I cared. And I was terrified. It wasn't the asking her and her rejecting me that was scaring. I was actually scared of her saying yes, she would like to dance with me.

I had to learn how to think about this in a better way.

This made me realize why I constantly self deprecate before dancing. I always make jokes or make sure that my follower knows that I"m not as good as they are or that I'm not as advanced.

One night I saw Sebastian, a dancer I had seen taking beginner classes a few times, dancing really well after a relatively short time. He was dancing practically all night. He dance a tanda, then sit for a few minutes to then walk around the milonga cabacowing dancers as he walked. When someone looked back at him, he would invite them. If they didn't look at him he wouldn't even bother. Whenever he reached more and asked directly and got rejected he would just keep walking looking for the next one. That went on for a few hours. During that time, I danced a handful of times waiting for followers to ask me or for a nudge from a friend. When dancing, Sebastian had one very obvious characteristic. He was completely taken with the music. This is something I've been noticing with all good dancers whether they were on the beat or not. The music drove them fully. They had no time to think about the 24 things they needed to worry about or concern themselves with in order to dance.

I knew that this is what I needed to do.

In his book, Useful Not True, Derek Sivers says that you don't have to feel like someone to be that someone.

> Your outside doesn't need to match your inside.
> You can feel terrified inside, but just pretend to be brave for one minute. By doing that, you were actually brave.
> You are your actions. Your actions are you. Your self-image doesn't matter as much.
> When you realize what you need to do, it doesn't mean that's who you need to be. You can just pretend.

As a newly minted dancer, I wanted to pretend that I'm comfortable taking on the responsibility of showing my partner a good time by creating a couple that's absorbed with the music...

## Ideas

* Are you a frog or a horse: use analogies of types of people and how to break them in. Boling frogs (gradual or immidiate like breaking in a horse). Study the sources of these to see how you can work them in at some point into this chapter.
* Remember that eventually we need to revisit rejection in this chapter and how we got over it by embodying the identity of a dancer.
