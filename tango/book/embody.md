# Embodying a Dancer

// this first section is about removing all my blocks that are stopping me from dancing

<span class="new-sub-section">What do dancers do? They dance.</span>

What have I been doing for the majority of my tango time? I was stuck in learning mode. I wanted to be so good that when I went out there I could immediately impress (not necessarily others as much as myself). However, what I found out was that going into someone's embrace and being my true self comfortably is its own kind of practice. I needed to be in enough embraces and feel vulnerable enough times until I could understand what it meant to be at ease in my own skin.

I invented elaborate learning systems that were going to make me ready for milongas. Unbeknowst to me at the time, these were fear avoidance strategies camouflaged as necessary prerequisites to dancing. I went into them with an assumption that they would take a long time to complete because dance is a skill that required mastery and mastery takes a lifetime. What a comforting feeling it must have been for my subconcious to know that it will never have to face the inevitable. This artifivial barrier became clear to me when I heard a talk by Oliver Burkeman, author of Four Thousand Weeks address this. Burkeman says that the reason that habit building or elaborate learning systems get in our way is because the change we’re contemplating is actually rather scary or uncomfortable and treating it as a long-term incremental project is a convenient way to push the difficult stuff to another time. Maybe I just needed to go out there and dance with other people and make mistakes and deal with whatever feelings and thoughts surfaced. I loved creating these systems because they also made me feel in control. Like I could take whatever challenge was in front of me and with some creative planning establish a process to overcome it. Burkman exposes this perfectly: "We want to see ourselves as the captain of the super yacht of our lives standing confidently on the bridge steering our life towards the future in which we will finally feel adequate and on top of things. Devising schemes for self improvement can really feed into that fantasy because you get to mentally project into the future all details all the nuts and bolts of how you’re going to get to that perfect future place. Where by contrast when you just do something with no promises about the future; when you just write a few paragraphs of your novel or sit and meditate for one session or suggest one meet up with a friend or go for one run, that requires the surrender of control because that’s not about steering the super yacht. That’s about launching your little canoe directly onto the rapids of reality and letting life take you wherever it’s going to take you." That talk exposed two fundamental blindspots in how I was aproaching my tango: I overplanned my curriculum in order to avoid my discomforts and I overindulged my controlling side that wanted to feel like it could take on any challenge.

One night, I sat out a whole milonga without asking for any dances from anyone. It felt like there was an almost palpable entity inside me preventing me from asking for dances. I got so upset that I decided that if I don't figure out how to ask for dances and enjoy them, I was going to quit tango and pickup an easier hobby like woodcarving. I was back face to face with the fear of rejection and there was no way around it, I had to face it in order to embody my new identity. As I dug deeper into the composition of my fear of rejection I realized that it wasn't rejection that I was afraid of. It was acceptance. I was afraid of dancers accepting my invite, but I was using rejection as an excuse to keep me seated. Here's what it means in tango when someone says yes to your invite: your first responsibility is protecting your partner from other dancers that could be bouncing into you from all directions. In milongas there's always a mix of beginners that don't know how to navigate the floor with experienced dancers that know how to navigate, but don't respect the code with others that just happened to be where you wanted to go. There's also the embrace. It's a subtle act of balance: I cannot embrace her too tightly or she'll be uncomfortable, too loosely and she'll be lost. I must embrace her within the goldylocks range where I have clear demarcated boundaries that communicate the notion of don't worry, there's someone in charge at the helm, but also of the tenderness of holding a baby. I will have to maintain this embrace and multiple variations of it (because it's different for every partner I dance with) throughout the tanda. Add to the body guard role and the delicate embrace the rich and deep world of tango music. A genre so deep that it stands on its own without the dance. If I were to follow the advice of good dancers, I would have to somehow magically convert my body to a musical instruments and express myself through it. I need to transmit this musicality to my partner in a way that she could understand it or we'll be stepping on each other's feet. These are just a few of the expected responsibilities a leader must assume. I also had my own set of expectations that fall into two buckets. The first was mostly about impressing others. The second was about making my crushes fall in love with me. I added to these all the subconcious muck that I'm not even aware of and reached the conclusion that I was afraid of the responsibility, not the rejection.

In his book, Useful Not True, Derek Sivers says that you don't have to feel like someone to be that someone. Your self-image doesn't matter that much as long as you are taking action. You are your actions. Your actions are you. You can feel terrified inside, but just pretend to be brave for one minute. By doing that, you were actually brave. After my enlightenment, I felt the palpable entity that sat in my chest and caused my inhibition disappear. I believe that was because my mind knew that it could handle responsibility and once it became aware that that was the cause of my inhibition, it let go[^1]. Since that point on I barely sat at milongas. Whenver I arrived at one, I looked for someone that I felt like I would like to dance with and went straight for them. If I didn't find someone specific, I asked people from the nearest table and then the next until I had my fill for the night. In some dances I felt anxious, in others I felt flow and in others I felt joy. It didn't matter. I was dancing and I finally started to glimpse what it was like to be a dancer.

[^1]: after this experience, I'm convinced that once the mind understands and is clearly aware of the cause of its inhibition, then it can start moving forward. In moving forward, there will be fear and other emotional and mental challenges, but it won't be inhibition. So if you feel inhibited, look for what's blocking you and understand it. It will resolve itself and you'll start moving forward.

As the fear of rejection dwindled their number increased with the number of dances. Suprisingly, that had little effect on me. It was like asking someone 'is this the line for the icecream?' and them responding 'no, this is the line for chocolate, icecream is over there' and I simply proceeded to get my icecream. I was embarrased with my self at how insignificant it felt because just a short time ago it immobilized me in my seat for hours. I was expecting a bigger fight, but understanding lead to peace. When I saw these rejections with equanimity it became clear that they are part of becoming a dancer. In fact rejection is part of any type of growth. I was rejected by a dozen companies before I got an engineering job. I was rejected by several women before I had found my girlfriend. I was rejected by many leads before I found my business its first customer. Every one of those rejections felt different than the other, resulted in different reactions, and required a different set of tools to deal with them. What was common was that when I learned how deal with them, they moved out of the way. They still felt unpleasant, but they were not blocking anymore. In tango, what makes rejection unique is that it happens more often and you get to see the person that rejected you regularly. So you must deal with it accordingly. I discussed this topic with a few seasoned dancers, some of whom are world championship winners, and I was flabbergasted by the grudges they still held against women that rejected them at some random milonga many years prior. The intesity in which they recounted their stories and how they got their revenge later were comical. One dancer still rejected the cabaceos of a woman that rejected him more than ten years ago. I think if I had not spent the time to understand it, I would have reacted the same way they did. However after several rejections, I started to see them as a statistic. The more people said no to me, the more their collective faces blurred into a forgetfull memory. My focus went to the women that said yes to me (which where much more numerous) and I worked hard to remember how each made me feel and if I would like to dance with them again and if so, to which orquestra. From then on, I always reponded to rejections with a big smile and said "it's OK, thank you" (saying no is not easy). I also kept myself open to cabaceos or invites from women that had said no in the past.

Containing learning as a delay to dancing and learning how to think and react to rejection removed my main barriers to dancing. It felt like I woke from a multiyear slumber. Still a little groggy, but excited to make up for lost time. I decided to start journaling about every milonga I went to to capture where my mind and my heart were going. It was like trying to understand a bug by studying it under a magnifying glass. I called this era of my development A Bug Named Nash. It resulted in the biggest breakthroughs I had in years.

---

In the first period in of the Bug era, the Post Slumber Period, I became aware that my mind constantly went to several places. The first one was figuring out what the next step was going to be. As I was in the middle of a movement, my mind was adamant on figuring what it was I was going to do next: "This is the perfect moment for a parallel turn.", "I should do some more ochos here", "I want to practice right turns here, focus on technique here". I was anxious about not boring my partner, so I was constantly in a search for the next thing to come.

* Where is my mind?
  * What's the next step?
  * Is she bored? I am bored.
  * what should it think?
* Where is my heart?
  * it wants validation. It wants people to say, good job
  * shaky with someone who gives themselves completely. See note about sal3ouka.
  * The feelings and sensations on critique
  * what should it want?
* What kinds of questions to ask at a milonga
  * what kind of space is a milonga
  * see start of 100 dances note for the questions.
* Protect my interest
  * When folks critsize, how to handle and how not to slip back into letting palp return. Let's call it palp fiction (This is good for expansion in previous section). See notes under dance 10.

* fear of rejection, and overlearning not only are they imaginary distractions or camouflaged fears. They also serve of delaying what you might be afraid of finding out. Dancing really well will not get me a lot of sex or a lot of women. Going direct is ongoing work. Might need to revise realization that I'm afraid of responsibility not rejection based on this.
