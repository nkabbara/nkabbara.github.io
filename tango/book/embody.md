# Embodying a Dancer

What do dancers do? They dance.

What have I been doing for the majority of my tango time? I was stuck in learning mode for years. At first I was waiting to be ready, to feel ready so I could go out to the dance floor and just be great. I didn't want to be upcloe and vulnerable. I wanted to study really really hard then go show what I'm made of. However, what I came to find out that going into someone's embrace and being your true honest self comfortably is its own kind of practice. I needed to be in enough embraces and feel vulnerable enough times, until I could truly express myself.

_from here on we could discuss how I practiced to avoid dancing_

I was back face to face with the fear of rejection. There was no way around it, I had to face it in order to embody my new identity. It was either that, or take up wood carving as my artistic expression. As I dug deeper into the composition of my fear of rejection I realized that it wasn't rejection that I was afraid of. It was acceptance. I was afraid of dancers accepting my invite, but I was using rejection as an excuse to keep me seated. Here's what it means in tango when someone says yes to your invite: your first responsibility is protecting your partner from other dancers that could be bouncing into you from all directions. In milongas there's always a mix of beginners that don't know how to navigate the floor with experienced dancers that know how to navigate, but don't respect the code with good dancers that just happened to be where you wanted to go. You must do whatever you can to protect your partners dress from being ripped apart from someone elseds high heels. Or second most important, avoid her from getting a bruise. I must also reciprocate the good manners of dancers around me and not bounce into them. The embrace I offer to my partner is a subtle act of balance. I cannot embrace her too tightly or she'll be uncomfortable, too loosely and she'll be lost. I must embrace her withing the goldylocks spectrum where she knows what I'm proposing for her to do and she's comfortable and she feels all the past pain joy my heart has ever experienced. She could refuse the embrace that I offer her and suggest a different version to which I must adapt immediately. Within the song or even tanda, I must maintain the spirit of the embrace that we settled on or the dance will feel imbalanced. I must convert my body into a musical instrumant and make it part of the orchestra that's being played. My tone must change with the changes in the song a song that changes every 30 seconds or so. If I don't do that then I might as well get high on extacy (and spike my partner's drink with some) and bounce my hand monotonically in a rave. But no, I must drug her the natural and hard way. And do all these things while giving myself and my partner a good time. _more insights about what my mind was doing here_


_here I can expand into how I practiced to avoid dancing_

Going to the dance floor with a mindset of discovery and a stronger presence to monitor what I was doing and how I was feeling was one of the biggest breakthroughs I had in years. It was like studying a bug with a magnifying glass to understand its patterns of behavior. I called this era of my development A Bug Named Nash.

_from here on we could divide the sections by Bug Named Nash sub periods_

In the first period in of the Bug era, I became aware that my mind constantly went to several places. The first one was figuring out what the next step was going to be. As I was in the middle of a movement, my mind was adamant on figuring what it was I was going to do next: "This is the perfect moment for a parallel turn.", "I should do some more ochos here", "I want to practice right turns here, focus on technique here". I was anxious about not boring my partner, so I was constantly in a search for the next thing to come.

## Ideas

* Permanent student
* Your worth at milongas changes because you feel like people evaluate you on how you dance, not on who you are or how you are as a person.
* a mantra to get into the music zone. How to stop learning mode and practice mode and actually dance.
* Are you a frog or a horse: use analogies of types of people and how to break them in. Boling frogs (gradual or immidiate like breaking in a horse). Study the sources of these to see how you can work them in at some point into this chapter.
* Remember that eventually we need to revisit rejection in this chapter and how we got over it by embodying the identity of a dancer.
> It's not about how well you play, it's how you feel about what you play.
* In his book, Useful Not True, Derek Sivers says that you don't have to feel like someone to be that someone.
> Your outside doesn't need to match your inside.
> You can feel terrified inside, but just pretend to be brave for one minute. By doing that, you were actually brave.
> You are your actions. Your actions are you. Your self-image doesn't matter as much.
> When you realize what you need to do, it doesn't mean that's who you need to be. You can just pretend.
* There is acting in dancing, but you don't just simply pick a character. You need to dance at least 100 dances to discover who it is you really can be.
* What you remember is not the steps you made or the mistakes you made. You remember how it felt. So we are looking for connection in a milonga, the sacred place.
* Find the oomph in your dance. Nothing is passive. When in embrace everything is active.
