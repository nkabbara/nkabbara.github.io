# Embodying a Dancer

What does a dancer do? He dances.

Up until a specific moment in time, I did everything in my power to avoid dancing. All camouflaged as beneficial activities that eventually will make me a better dancer (mention yelizabeta podcast where she encourages to go out and dance) so that I could dance one day. One of these was technique practice. I set aside an hour a day where I meticoulasly went over every note my teacher gave and practiced it in my living room with an imaginary dancer partner. My neighbors in the building accross regularly saw me hugging pillows stacked on top of each other to simulate a human torso and walking in cirles around my dining table. I practiced my embrace by imagining my right hand over Pillow's right scapula while keeping my right elbow engaged attempting to build a connection with her on my right side.

## Ideas

* Permanent student
* Your worth at milongas changes because you feel like people evaluate you on how you dance, not on who you are or how you are as a person.
* a mantra to get into the music zone. How to stop learning mode and practice mode and actually dance.
* Are you a frog or a horse: use analogies of types of people and how to break them in. Boling frogs (gradual or immidiate like breaking in a horse). Study the sources of these to see how you can work them in at some point into this chapter.
* Remember that eventually we need to revisit rejection in this chapter and how we got over it by embodying the identity of a dancer.
> It's not about how well you play, it's how you feel about what you play.
* In his book, Useful Not True, Derek Sivers says that you don't have to feel like someone to be that someone.
> Your outside doesn't need to match your inside.
> You can feel terrified inside, but just pretend to be brave for one minute. By doing that, you were actually brave.
> You are your actions. Your actions are you. Your self-image doesn't matter as much.
> When you realize what you need to do, it doesn't mean that's who you need to be. You can just pretend.
* There is acting in dancing, but you don't just simply pick a character. You need to dance at least 100 dances to discover who it is you really can be.
* What you remember is not the steps you made or the mistakes you made. You remember how it felt. So we are looking for connection in a milonga, the sacred place.
* Find the oomph in your dance. Nothing is passive. When in embrace everything is active.
