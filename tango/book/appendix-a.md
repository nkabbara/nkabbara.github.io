# Mantras

## Milonga Mantra

On my way to a milonga, I start taking deep breaths. I pay attention to the sensation of a location from which I am aware of these breaths. _This is usually behind my eyes somewhere_. I start dropping the sensation of location down to my jaw, then my neck, then shoulders, heart, abdomen, pelvis, legs, feet, then finally to the ground.

Notes: I am moving the anxious anxiety from my overactive mind, down into my loving heart down into the ground. As it comes back, I repeat.

## Asking Mantra

_For this to work, I first created a challenge for myself: I asked one hundred new dancers to dance. I included everyone, especially dancers that intimidated me. That gave the tool to create this mantra._

Whenever I feel any kind of force keeping me in my seat or blocking me from asking for dances, I repeat in my head: "Remember the one hundred dances. Ninety people said yes and only ten said no. Some of those ten later changed their mind. Go get them dances!"
