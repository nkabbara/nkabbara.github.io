# Mantras

## Milonga Mantra

On my way to a milonga, I start taking deep breaths. I pay attention to the sensation of a location from which I am aware of these breaths. _This is usually behind my eyes somewhere_. I start dropping the sensation of location down to my jaw, then my neck, then shoulders, heart, abdomen, pelvis, legs, feet, then finally to the ground.

Notes: I am moving the anxious anxiety from my overactive mind, down into my loving heart down into the ground. As it comes back, I repeat.

## Asking Mantra

_For this to work, I first created a challenge for myself: I asked one hundred new dancers to dance. I included everyone, especially dancers that intimidated me. That gave the tool to create this mantra._

Whenever I feel any kind of force keeping me in my seat or blocking me from asking for dances, I repeat in my head: "Remember the one hundred dances. Ninety people said yes and only ten said no. Some of those ten later changed their mind. Go get them dances!"

## First Embrace Mantra

On my first contact with someone I'm looking to build our embrace: I start with feeling my feet into the ground. I then move my pelvis to find my grounding and to open the space. I then find my presense and give it to my partner completely. This is like an energy projecting from my torso to hers. It's saying, today, I am here for you in this form. And wait to see what she gives me in return. Then my arms surround my presense and hers. I go muscle deep into her with all the parts of my arms that touch her to communicate what I want with precision and clarity. I then look for her breath and mine and sync them together.
