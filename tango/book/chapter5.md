# Protecting My Tango

I realized that tango can be the most generous thing in the world given that I am honest with it. Otherwise, it will throw me so much off kilter that I will hate myself for ages. What am in this for? Do I want to get laid a lot? No worries, tango got me. Am I looking for love, no worries tango got me. Am I looking to make friends, no worries tango got me. Am I looking to show off and impress people, no worries tango got me. Am I looking to have something to do during evenings because otherwise I'd be on tv, no worries tango got me. Am I looking for human connection by embracing people, no worries tango got me. Am I looking to listen to good complex music while watching people dance to it, no worries tango got me. Am I looking to express my creativity and share it with others, no worries tango got me. Does dancing with beautiful women fill an insecuirty of mine, no worries tango got me.  The deal though is that all this is not for free. In order for tango to serve you, you must be completely honest with yourself in order to be able to be completely honest with it and what you want from it. I learned really slowly that if I go into tango not knowing exactly what I wanted from it or if I misled it in thinking one thing while I was actually seeking another, that it will retaliate is with psychological torment. Even if what I am seeking is too embarracing to write down or state, I have to be very clear in my heart and my head that that is what I am going for.

So this brings me to me, what do I want from tango as I am writing this today? The old reason was seeing El Flaco an old and wrinkly man dance with a beautiful woman. I thought that ok, I want to be him. I want to dance with beautiful women at that age. But how about now? What is it?

I know it's bullshit to say that I'm doing it because of the joy it gives me when performing it with someone. There are moments when I've glimmered its enjoyment, moments where I was in a mystical state. Moments where I like the girl. Moments where I used to tango to impress girls outside of tango. 

So why am I Nash doing it? I know I love coding because I'm creating things and I'm leraning the process and I enjoy my time alone and in deep work. But too much of that work without a companion gives me nothing afterwards.

Why am I practicing? Why am I throwing money at teachers? Why am I going to El Bondi? Why am I going to El Motivo? Why am I wanting to improve at this dance? Why am I doing any of these things? What if it's not one thing? What if it's a multitude of things? I started the chapter with unity and friendship. But whas has my journey showed me? Could tango be a multitude of things? Could I be doing it because I like to hang out with my friends? I like to dance a little bit. I like to socialize in a controlled environment where I can walk out anytime I want. I like to get embraced and I like to play a game where when you're good you get more so you try to get good. When I'm in a relationship with a tanguera, I like to show her off to others. I like to say no in such a way that doesn't make the other person feel like shit. I like to take complete a bad tanda with someone in order not to turn their tango into regression. And when I'm single, yes, I want to meet my partner through tango. And yes, I want to seek revenge on the world by spending a whole night in embraces with beautiful women. Tango gives me all that.

The moment tango stops giving me all that is when I pigeonhole myself into any of these things. When I delude myself into thinking that I want to be so good that everyone would want to dance iwth me. That leads me into a state of insecurity because it counterfactual and no matter how good I get no one would want to dance with me. If I start being an arrogant asshole because of my abilities, that's a give away of what would happen outside of tango if I were to gain power or fame because of my wealth. 

The things in tango that get the most of my attention are usually the things that I need to either protect or change. If I find myself gossiping counterproductively about people then that's a sign for me to change something. If I find myself disenjoying dancing with specific people, then I need to protect my time and dance from them. When I started to look at tango as this huge encosystem where many parts of me can find some sort of fullfillment and entertainment, not one thing could take over and ruin my relationship with it. Because of that, I find it even more attractive to hang on to specific milongas. Jumping around for one milonga to another would completely fullfill my need of seeking amazing tandas, but going to the same milonga all the time, builds a sense of community and friendship for me and also puts many parts of me to the social test. I don't have a family yet, no parents in law to complain about, no kids to relax my ego on because I will be their god for 13 years, no sense of little community of my own. I am not religious to go to churche and make connections there. Tango provides me with all these things provided that I set certain habits around it. And within that ecosystem, I can choose many different kinds of challenges to explore and put up with. Am I insecure asking someone to dance, that could be a challenge. Am I not feeling like dancing, then it's ok just watching people for the night. Am I not wanting to ask anyone to dance, but would accept any dance from anyone, then I can be like that all night. 

I sometimes forget that all tango is is a social activity with more complexity and depth than say tennis or clubbing. But in the end, it's just a dance with a social structure around it. Many tend to turn that into something sacrosanct. No, it's just damn dance. Boy wants to dance with girl, girl plays hard to get. That's it. No more. No less. All tango is is like everything else in the world, boy wants to meet girl. Girl plays hard to get. Boy instead of going after girl more, wants to become world chapion dancer then ignores girl (there is something here). 

What I'm coming to realize is that there's many things I like about tango. The biggest being, learning. I love to learn the steps and the biomechanics after them. What I don't like is myself, when I go to socials and sit down and expect dances instead of asking everyone under the sun to dance with me. I don't like that. I know I have enough skill to dance with many of the dances, especially early on, but I don't like myself when I just sit. I need a mantra to keep me up. It's the 50 dances mantra. Just ask everyone you feel like you'd like to dance with. We have the 50 mantra and we also have the waiting for me and also the wanting to dance all night. Maybe stating that will help me. I need a getting dances mantra. I don't think it's fear of rejection. It's something else.

## Notes

The exhiliration could be a thing. If it's not there it's ok. There's also the separation between friend, lover and dancer.
