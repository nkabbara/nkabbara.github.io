There's room to augment many things here including my tango origin story and also my general improvements due to tango

_2. Why am I always looking for a reason of why I am in tango? because I was lying._

# Protecting My Tango

My first exposure to tango was an old video by a charismtic dancer called El Flaco Dani. El Flaco was in his seventies, he had a long longing and drupy face so full of wrinkles that his wrinkles were wrinkled. He was dancing a milonga with the young and beautiful Silvina Valz. I still clearly remember the thought that ran through my mind: I can be in my seventies and dancing like this with such young and beautiful women? I struggled with writing this final chapter because I kept looking for the real reason that I started and stayed in tango and whatever I wrote down was a lie. I was trying to sensatinality and spiritualize my hobby. But in the end, I came to realize, I'm just as guilty as succumbing to my lizard brain as an actual lizard running after a fly. My fly is beautiful and elegant women that have dedicated a bunch of their time to their art. I like to be around them. I think my struggle in admitting this stems from not wanting to look vain to myself and to others. But if that's who I was then and I was better off accepting it and acting it out otherwise I was doomed to be in perpetual denial and stuck there. I started this memoir saying that Unity and Friendship are what tango was for me. That was bullshit too. In telling myself that story, I was simmply complicating Vonnegut's famous Girl-Meets-Boy story arc that we all experience at some point: Boy meets their dream girl, experiences momentary bliss, screws everything up, and then fights for redemption and wins. In my case, it was the same arc except multiply the screws-everytying-up part by a big number. In a late night conversation with a good friend, my soulmate, she retiliated to my statement that women are always looking to change men by saying "no, we are improving you guys. Whenever I meet a guy and he says to me that's he's into pottery or poetry or cooking, I immediately know that he's had experience with women because he's a finer human being. No man in his right mind signs up for pottery classes on his own. There was a woman there." I disagreed profusely, but thinking about it later, I came to realize that in my vain persuit, I had built more character. I was more courageous, more humble, and more honest. As I wrote these words, I felt freed from my delusional shackles. I'm free to go out and just relish the in the female beautiy and be around it. I don't have to camouflage my first reaction El Flaco's video with more refined tales like I love the dance itself or I'm chasing after a mystical sensation that comes once every blue moon. Those things are true, but they're not my drive. That admission, gave me even more impulse to work harder on my dance to dance with more elegant and refined women and meet more challenges along the way. Once I became honest with myself I could also see a multitude of gifts that tango had give me. When I felt lonely, I could go to my neighborhood milonga and just hang there. When I felt like getting laid, I knew which milongas increased my changes. When I wanted to get inspired, I knew which milonga had top performers. When I wanted to listen to good music, I knew where the best bands played. When I wanted to impress, I knew which milonga had beginners. When I wanted to just dance, I knew which milonga had dancers compatible with me. When I got tired of tango, I knew that it would be there for me. The only thing that it demanded in return was to tell it exactly what it was that I wanted from it. But the gift that I might not be able to match throughout my life was the friends that it gave me. People that touched my life in ways that changed me and changed them and continues to do so.

I wanted to protect my tango in my life for all this generousity. I knew my mind could be its first enemy and that's why I've created mantras (see Appendix A) that I could change as I change to keep tango safe in my life. These mantras are designed to put my mind in the right place whenever it creates monsters. I discovered that most of my impedements in tango are imaginary and further discovered that also courage is imaginary. If my imagination was strong enough to create monsters, then I could train it to create courageous heros to kill those monsters. The bigger boogie man, the bigger hero.
