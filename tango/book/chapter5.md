# Protecting My Tango

I struggled with writing this final chapter because I kept looking for the real reason that I started tango and whatever I wrote down was bullshit. I was trying to sensatinality and spiritualize my hobby. But in the end, I came to realize, I'm just as guilty as succumbing to my lizard brain as an actual lizard running after a fly. My fly is beautiful and elegant women that have dedicated a bunch of their time to their art. I want to be around them and dance with them amongst other thigns. I think my struggle in admitting this stems from not wanting to be vain to myself and to others. But if that's who I am right now, I'm better off accepting it and acting it out otherwise I'm doomed to be in perpetual denial and stuck here. I started this memoir saying that Unity and Friendship are what kept me in tango. That was bullshit too. In telling myself that story, I was simmply complicating Vonnegut's famous Girl-Meets-Boy story arc that we all experience at some point: Boy meets their dream girl, experiences momentary bliss, screws everything up, and then fights for redemption and wins. In my case, it's the same arc except multiply the screws-everytying-up part by a big number. In a late night conversation with a good friend, my soulmate, retiliated to my statement that women are always looking to change men by saying "no, we are improving you guys. Whenever I meet a guy and he says to me that's he's into pottery or poetry or cooking, I immediately know that he's had experience with women because he's a finer human being. No man in his right mind signs up for pottery classes. There was a woman there." I disagreed profusely, but thinking about it later, I came to realize that in my vain persuit, I have become a much better person. More courageous, more humble, and more honest. As I'm writing these words, I feel freed from my delusional shackles. Like I'm free to go out and just relish the in the female beautiy and be around it. This admission, gives me even more impulse to work harder on my dance to dance with more elegant and refined women and meet more challenges along the way. My first rule of tango therefore is be honest with yourself. I'm currently in it to be around and dance with beautiful and elegant women. 


I started this memoir with the reasons that I got into tango was friendship and unity. And these things do hold value for me, but they're really not why I push through my comfort zone, improve my skill, go through rejection and grow as a person. The realy reason is because I'm attracted to beautiful and elegant women that are dedicated to their art. It could be any art like playing the piano or painting, but as luck would have it, I'm in tango circle.

## Brain Dump

Then I moved to buenos aires. I had no excuses anymore. I tried to beat around the bushes, but everything I needed to become better at tango was there. If I didn't become better, it was totally on me. I had to face the fact of whether I needed to continue or whether I needed to stop. It put face to face with a challenge that I took on and this memoir's purpose was to keep me honest. So in case at the end of my journey I decided that tango is not for me, it wouldn't be because I face a challenge and gave up on it without first thinking deeply about it and learning whether it's because it's something that I don't want to do.I'm now reaching the end of my book and I have to be compeltely honest for when in the future I take a look at this book.

The fact that I'm in tango is because I love beautiful women that have a sense of elegence. An objectively unattractive women to me that has put in the hard work on her hobby is something that attracts me. Tango is full of beautiful and talented women. I'm attracted to the artistic types and I found a place where I could put myself in their midst. That's my current main driver. For me to be in this community and involved in it, I have to have a certain level of skill to enjoy myself, otherwise, I'll be at teh periphery. Another thing that attracts me in tango is making friends. Most of my friends have some relationship to tango. Some only like the music, others the dance, other are in it just to have something to do because it's better than TV, others love the challenge. What I love about tango is

* Beautiful elegant women that put in work into their hobby and passion. Hard working, passionate, introverted, mostly cat lovers.
* My hard work with my dance and with my self image and psycohology is easily measured with the dances I get. Not because people are dancing with me or said yes to dance with me,  but because I have the gull to get up and ask. How I react to rejection says a lot about what kind of person I am or what kind of person I want to become.
*  The idea of tango, the embraces, the flow, the mysticism in it, the epemeral love, the culture, the idea that I'm in a deep embrace with someone and I'm making them happy and they're making me happy just the idea, not actually doing it gives me pleasure.

What I need to manage about tango:
* Socials have to end at 11:30 for me. I dont' stay longer and prefer daytime milongas.
* Sitting down waiting for smeone to ask me for dances makes miserable. I am happier when I dance with new people and explore their sensations and how they make me feel.
* New milongas make me nervous. I prefer going to regular milongas at regular times and waking out. Get my fill of dances. With friends, it makes them easier.
* I hate how my mind places some people at pedestals and makes it hard for me to ask them for dances. It takes enjoyment out of the dance. Or how it weirds out sitiation by waiting an extended amount of time.

I like the idea of breaking soemthing up if it was conflated, like people. You might think of people as one thing. Dancers. I'm here to dance and all these people view me as a dancer and my whole value is how good of a dancer I am. But the fact is that there's more resolution. There are at least three things going on. One, you can make friends with people there and not ever dance with them. Two you can date people there. Three you can dance with people. The three don't need to be combined.

The same idea applies to your skill. People don't want to dance with your because of your skill. Well, at least a third of them do, but others want to dane witj me because they see me as handsome, others because they like me. Others because for my skill, but even that has different resolutions: because they'r ebelow my skill and want to enjoy my abilities. Because they match me and want to enjoy a good dance or because they're better than me and want to use me as practice. Tango is a subtle and complicated world. Don't try to impose your ideas on it. Instead, go with the flow and you'll be surpsied at what you might .

The same thing with 


Kurt Vonnegut's famous Girl-Meets-Boy arc goes something like this: Boy meets their dream girl, experiences momentary bliss, screws everything up, and then fights for redemption and wins. Everyone goes home happy. My arc in tango is completely screwed up. I meet my dream girl, I do not experience momentary bliss because I think that I have to become a better dancer before I can even say hello to her, I screw everything up, then I screw everything up some more, then I fight for redemption and end up with a completely different girl. I've come to find out that tango is the perfect ecosystem to invent imaginary walls to put obstacles between myself and what I want. Whether it's being able to sit at a table with a specific group, or dance with a specific person or ask someone out, tango provides me with many ways of saying, I will when... That when could be I get better, I or become more regular, or take more classes. I found out that to maintain a healthy relationship with it, I needed to go direct towards the things I wanted or I'd be deceiving it.


What I've come to find out that tango is all those things for me. At some point, I might be after a woman that I find extermely attactive and I'm trying everything I can to get her attention. At other points, I'm nerding out on the biomechanics of movement on the way to improving my saccadas. At another time, I'm going deep into the music to understand its elements and learn how to appreaciate it more. I've even obsessed over its roots and history and the sense of nostalgia it brings. It also gives me comfort that deep into my 70s I can have a hobby to spend my last decade in. Chance are I will find my wife in tango or I will find out her outside of tango but get her attention with the fact that I dance.I want to make it part of my life and I want to have a good relationship with it which I must have a good relationship with the people in it.

There might be stages where I will say or do that, but in tango, in order to stay the same, you must keep changing. As you insecurities shift from one area in your life to another, I must work up the courage to accomodate. 

I can be my won worst enemy when it comes to tango. In order to keep a good relationship with tango, I must find my way of being happy with it. I know late night and late mornings are not for me. I know I will miss out on the better parts of milongas, but I'm in this for life. Besides I will be one of the few good dancers that come in early, I don't have to compete with the pros that arrive later during the night. 

I know that my places unecessary challenges where I could go direct. I see a girl I like and that I can see myself with and I suddenly build up a set of tasks that must be completed before I even make contact with her. Like I must reach level X or I must become a regular or I must do X in order to talk to her first. This kind of behavior just makes my milonga experiences layers with shadowy and unnecessary thought. Just go direct. If I'm not ready, it's ok, but know that there are no required steps to do anything in tango. The important thing is being honest with yourself. (maybe a story about a girl I like that I placed all these ridiculous imaginary steps to go out with her and it turns out she's married with three kids)

### Brain Dump

1. Story about el flaco dancing. How it pulled me into tango
2. Then I came to realize tango is much bigger than that

I know it's bullshit to say that I'm doing it because of the joy it gives me when performing it with someone. There are moments when I've glimmered its enjoyment, moments where I was in a mystical state. Moments where I like the girl. Moments where I used to tango to impress girls outside of tango. 

The moment tango stops giving me all that is when I pigeonhole myself into any of these things. When I delude myself into thinking that I want to be so good that everyone would want to dance iwth me. That leads me into a state of insecurity because it counterfactual and no matter how good I get no one would want to dance with me. If I start being an arrogant asshole because of my abilities, that's a give away of what would happen outside of tango if I were to gain power or fame or wealth. 

I don't have a family yet, no parents in law to complain about, no kids to relax my ego on because I will be their god for 13 years, no sense of little community of my own. I am not religious to go to churche and make connections there. Tango provides me with all these things provided that I set certain habits around it. And within that ecosystem, I can choose many different kinds of challenges to explore and put up with. Am I insecure asking someone to dance, that could be a challenge. Am I not feeling like dancing, then it's ok just watching people for the night. Am I not wanting to ask anyone to dance, but would accept any dance from anyone, then I can be like that all night. 

I sometimes forget that all tango is is a social activity with more complexity and depth than say tennis or clubbing. But in the end, it's just a dance with a social structure around it. Many tend to turn that into something sacrosanct. No, it's just damn dance. Boy wants to dance with girl, girl plays hard to get. That's it. No more. No less. All tango is is like everything else in the world, boy wants to meet girl. Girl plays hard to get. Boy instead of going after girl more, wants to become world chapion dancer then ignores girl (there is something here). Tango's story's arc.

What I'm coming to realize is that there's many things I like about tango. The biggest being, learning. I love to learn the steps and the biomechanics after them. What I don't like is myself, when I go to socials and sit down and expect dances instead of asking everyone under the sun to dance with me. I don't like that. I know I have enough skill to dance with many of the dances, especially early on, but I don't like myself when I just sit. I need a mantra to keep me up.

## Notes

The exhiliration could be a thing. If it's not there it's ok. There's also the separation between friend, lover and dancer.
