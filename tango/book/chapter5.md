# Protecting My Tango

## Outline

1. Tango is the most generous. Enumerate what it can do for you.
2. Protecting tango from me. Mental & physical health.
3. Protecting tango from other people.
4. 

Tango is the most generous phenomenon in my life. Am I looking to get laid? I know which milongas to go to to increase my chances. Am I looking for love? I know which milongas have my type of people. Am I looking to show off my dancing? I know which milongas have average dancers. Am I looking for entertainment? I know which milongas have the best music and which milongas have the most drama. Am I looking to express my creativity and share it with another person? I know which milongas have a relaxed and experimental vibe. Am I looking to get inspired? I know which milongas have the best dancers in the city. Am I looking to make friends? I start going consistently to the same milonga. Am I tired of tango and don't want anything to do with it anymore? I know that it will be there for me when I return. But for me to be able to enjoy all this generousity, I must be completely honest with it. That's the deal. And I learned that for me to be honest with it, I must first be completely honest with myself. I tried to deceive it for the longest time by asking for one thing while what I was really looking for was something else and I was in for a world of hurt.

What I've come to find out that tango is all those things for me. At some point, I might be after a woman that I find extermely attactive and I'm trying everything I can to get her attention. At other points, I'm nerding out on the biomechanics of movement on the way to improving my saccadas. At another time, I'm going deep into the music to understand its elements and learn how to appreaciate it more. I've even obsessed over its roots and history and the sense of nostalgia it brings. It also gives me comfort that deep into my 70s I can have a hobby to spend my last decade in. Chance are I will find my wife in tango or I will find out her outside of tango but get her attention with the fact that I dance.I want to make it part of my life and I want to have a good relationship with it which I must have a good relationship with the people in it.

I feel like I'm on prepetual path of learning and improving and I'm coming to accept that this will probably be a lifetime endeavor. There is not point in tango where I will stop, this is it. I will stop learning now and I will dance like so. There might be stages where I will say or do that, but in tango, in order to stay the same, you must keep changing. As you insecurities shift from one area in your life to another, I must work up the courage to accomodate. 

I can be my won worst enemy when it comes to tango. In order to keep a good relationship with tango, I must find my way of being happy with it. I know late night and late mornings are not for me. I know I will miss out on the better parts of milongas, but I'm in this for life. Besides I will be one of the few good dancers that come in early, I don't have to compete with the pros that arrive later during the night. I know that my places unecessary challenges where I could go direct. I see a girl I like and that I can see myself with and I suddenly build up a set of tasks that must be completed before I even make contact with her. Like I must reach level X or I must become a regular or I must do X in order to talk to her first. This kind of behavior just makes my milonga experiences layers with shadowy and unnecessary thought. Just go direct. If I'm not ready, it's ok, but know that there are no required steps to do anything in tango. The important thing is being honest with yourself. (maybe a story about a girl I like that I placed all these ridiculous imaginary steps to go out with her and it turns out she's married with three kids)

You friends could be your worst enemies. I have a whom I trust in many areas in my life, but when it comes to tango, I cannot take her comments seriously because they're an expression of competitiveness. A feeling of I cannot improve more than she can always surfaces. She makes snyde comments whenever I'm working hard on something. I have another friend that is easily excitable. Any new thing I do or any new experiment she sheds it under the most positive light ever. And I have a third friend that is able to take herself out of the picture and try to be objective about what is going on. In the end when it comes to friends the best ones are the ones that are willing to let you go for your own happiness. The ones that want you to succeed even if that means that they will never see you again. These are hard to come by because we're all deficient in some manner and sometimes it's our combination that reveals the best parts of who we are. If you're lucky to combine with people that fall into the third camp hang on to them in your journey until you're ready to move on. They  will let you go gracefully.

Other people are a mix of well meaning, but socially challenged individules to pure assholes. Just stay away from then for as long as you can. They don't like you for one form or another. Whatever.


### Brain Dump

So this brings me to me, what do I want from tango as I am writing this today? The old reason was seeing El Flaco an old and wrinkly man dance with a beautiful woman. I thought that ok, I want to be him. I want to dance with beautiful women at that age. But how about now? What is it?

I know it's bullshit to say that I'm doing it because of the joy it gives me when performing it with someone. There are moments when I've glimmered its enjoyment, moments where I was in a mystical state. Moments where I like the girl. Moments where I used to tango to impress girls outside of tango. 

Why am I practicing? Why am I throwing money at teachers? Why am I going to El Bondi? Why am I going to El Motivo? Why am I wanting to improve at this dance? Why am I doing any of these things? What if it's not one thing? What if it's a multitude of things? I started the chapter with unity and friendship. But whas has my journey showed me? Could tango be a multitude of things? Could I be doing it because I like to hang out with my friends? I like to dance a little bit. I like to socialize in a controlled environment where I can walk out anytime I want. I like to get embraced and I like to play a game where when you're good you get more so you try to get good. When I'm in a relationship with a tanguera, I like to show her off to others. I like to say no in such a way that doesn't make the other person feel like shit. I like to take complete a bad tanda with someone in order not to turn their tango into regression. And when I'm single, yes, I want to meet my partner through tango. And yes, I want to seek revenge on the world by spending a whole night in embraces with beautiful women. Tango gives me all that.

The moment tango stops giving me all that is when I pigeonhole myself into any of these things. When I delude myself into thinking that I want to be so good that everyone would want to dance iwth me. That leads me into a state of insecurity because it counterfactual and no matter how good I get no one would want to dance with me. If I start being an arrogant asshole because of my abilities, that's a give away of what would happen outside of tango if I were to gain power or fame or wealth. 

The things in tango that get the most of my attention are usually the things that I need to either protect or change. If I find myself gossiping counterproductively about people then that's a sign for me to change something. If I find myself disenjoying dancing with specific people, then I need to protect my time and dance from them. When I started to look at tango as this huge encosystem where many parts of me can find some sort of fullfillment and entertainment, not one thing could take over and ruin my relationship with it. Because of that, I find it even more attractive to hang on to specific milongas. Jumping around for one milonga to another would completely fullfill my need of seeking amazing tandas, but going to the same milonga all the time, builds a sense of community and friendship for me and also puts many parts of me to the social test. I don't have a family yet, no parents in law to complain about, no kids to relax my ego on because I will be their god for 13 years, no sense of little community of my own. I am not religious to go to churche and make connections there. Tango provides me with all these things provided that I set certain habits around it. And within that ecosystem, I can choose many different kinds of challenges to explore and put up with. Am I insecure asking someone to dance, that could be a challenge. Am I not feeling like dancing, then it's ok just watching people for the night. Am I not wanting to ask anyone to dance, but would accept any dance from anyone, then I can be like that all night. 

I sometimes forget that all tango is is a social activity with more complexity and depth than say tennis or clubbing. But in the end, it's just a dance with a social structure around it. Many tend to turn that into something sacrosanct. No, it's just damn dance. Boy wants to dance with girl, girl plays hard to get. That's it. No more. No less. All tango is is like everything else in the world, boy wants to meet girl. Girl plays hard to get. Boy instead of going after girl more, wants to become world chapion dancer then ignores girl (there is something here). 

What I'm coming to realize is that there's many things I like about tango. The biggest being, learning. I love to learn the steps and the biomechanics after them. What I don't like is myself, when I go to socials and sit down and expect dances instead of asking everyone under the sun to dance with me. I don't like that. I know I have enough skill to dance with many of the dances, especially early on, but I don't like myself when I just sit. I need a mantra to keep me up. It's the 50 dances mantra. Just ask everyone you feel like you'd like to dance with. We have the 50 mantra and we also have the waiting for me and also the wanting to dance all night. Maybe stating that will help me. I need a getting dances mantra. I don't think it's fear of rejection. It's something else. It's the wall.

## Notes

The exhiliration could be a thing. If it's not there it's ok. There's also the separation between friend, lover and dancer.
