1. Why I started tango? 
2. Why I stayed in tango?
3. Why am I always looking for a reason of why I am in tango?
4.  What if I'm afraid of stopping it, what would take its place? How would my social life look like?

# Protecting My Tango

My first exposure to tango was watching an old video by a charismtic dancer called El Flaco Dani. It was the seed that helped begin my journey. El Flaco was in his seventies, with a long longing and drupy face. A face so full of wrinkles that his wrinkles were wrinkled. He was dancing a milonga with the young and beautiful Silvina Valz. I still clearly remember the though that ran through my mind: I can be in my seventies and dancing like this with such beautoful women? Enough time passed to forget about El Flaco, but my brother Joad and I planned a trip to Argentina that revived that video in my memory and and brought tango into my life. We had planned the trip to argentina because we were enamoured the concept of Hot argentine women. We were young and shallower than we are now, to actually go and experience the culture. 


What good sotry do

Kurt Vonnegut's famous Girl-Meets-Boy arc goes something like this: Boy meets their dream girl, experiences momentary bliss, screws everything up, and then fights for redemption and wins. Everyone goes home happy. My arc in tango is completely screwed up. I meet my dream girl, I do not experience momentary bliss because I think that I have to become a better dancer before I can even say hello to her, I screw everything up, then I screw everything up some more, then I fight for redemption and end up with a completely different girl. I've come to find out that tango is the perfect ecosystem to invent imaginary walls to put obstacles between myself and what I want. Whether it's being able to sit at a table with a specific group, or dance with a specific person or ask someone out, tango provides me with many ways of saying, I will when... That when could be I get better, I or become more regular, or take more classes. I found out that to maintain a healthy relationship with it, I needed to go direct towards the things I wanted or I'd be deceiving it.


What I've come to find out that tango is all those things for me. At some point, I might be after a woman that I find extermely attactive and I'm trying everything I can to get her attention. At other points, I'm nerding out on the biomechanics of movement on the way to improving my saccadas. At another time, I'm going deep into the music to understand its elements and learn how to appreaciate it more. I've even obsessed over its roots and history and the sense of nostalgia it brings. It also gives me comfort that deep into my 70s I can have a hobby to spend my last decade in. Chance are I will find my wife in tango or I will find out her outside of tango but get her attention with the fact that I dance.I want to make it part of my life and I want to have a good relationship with it which I must have a good relationship with the people in it.

There might be stages where I will say or do that, but in tango, in order to stay the same, you must keep changing. As you insecurities shift from one area in your life to another, I must work up the courage to accomodate. 

I can be my won worst enemy when it comes to tango. In order to keep a good relationship with tango, I must find my way of being happy with it. I know late night and late mornings are not for me. I know I will miss out on the better parts of milongas, but I'm in this for life. Besides I will be one of the few good dancers that come in early, I don't have to compete with the pros that arrive later during the night. 

I know that my places unecessary challenges where I could go direct. I see a girl I like and that I can see myself with and I suddenly build up a set of tasks that must be completed before I even make contact with her. Like I must reach level X or I must become a regular or I must do X in order to talk to her first. This kind of behavior just makes my milonga experiences layers with shadowy and unnecessary thought. Just go direct. If I'm not ready, it's ok, but know that there are no required steps to do anything in tango. The important thing is being honest with yourself. (maybe a story about a girl I like that I placed all these ridiculous imaginary steps to go out with her and it turns out she's married with three kids)

### Brain Dump

1. Story about el flaco dancing. How it pulled me into tango
2. Then I came to realize tango is much bigger than that

I know it's bullshit to say that I'm doing it because of the joy it gives me when performing it with someone. There are moments when I've glimmered its enjoyment, moments where I was in a mystical state. Moments where I like the girl. Moments where I used to tango to impress girls outside of tango. 

The moment tango stops giving me all that is when I pigeonhole myself into any of these things. When I delude myself into thinking that I want to be so good that everyone would want to dance iwth me. That leads me into a state of insecurity because it counterfactual and no matter how good I get no one would want to dance with me. If I start being an arrogant asshole because of my abilities, that's a give away of what would happen outside of tango if I were to gain power or fame or wealth. 

I don't have a family yet, no parents in law to complain about, no kids to relax my ego on because I will be their god for 13 years, no sense of little community of my own. I am not religious to go to churche and make connections there. Tango provides me with all these things provided that I set certain habits around it. And within that ecosystem, I can choose many different kinds of challenges to explore and put up with. Am I insecure asking someone to dance, that could be a challenge. Am I not feeling like dancing, then it's ok just watching people for the night. Am I not wanting to ask anyone to dance, but would accept any dance from anyone, then I can be like that all night. 

I sometimes forget that all tango is is a social activity with more complexity and depth than say tennis or clubbing. But in the end, it's just a dance with a social structure around it. Many tend to turn that into something sacrosanct. No, it's just damn dance. Boy wants to dance with girl, girl plays hard to get. That's it. No more. No less. All tango is is like everything else in the world, boy wants to meet girl. Girl plays hard to get. Boy instead of going after girl more, wants to become world chapion dancer then ignores girl (there is something here). Tango's story's arc.

What I'm coming to realize is that there's many things I like about tango. The biggest being, learning. I love to learn the steps and the biomechanics after them. What I don't like is myself, when I go to socials and sit down and expect dances instead of asking everyone under the sun to dance with me. I don't like that. I know I have enough skill to dance with many of the dances, especially early on, but I don't like myself when I just sit. I need a mantra to keep me up.

## Notes

The exhiliration could be a thing. If it's not there it's ok. There's also the separation between friend, lover and dancer.
