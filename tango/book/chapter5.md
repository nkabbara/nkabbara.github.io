# Protecting My Tango

My first exposure to tango was an old video by a charismtic dancer called El Flaco Dani. El Flaco was in his seventies, he had a long longing and drupy face so full of wrinkles that his wrinkles were full of wrinkles. He was dancing a milonga with the young and beautiful Silvina Valz. I still clearly remember the thought that ran through my mind: I can be in my seventies and dance like that with such young and beautiful women? I struggled with writing this chapter because I kept looking for the real reason that I started and stayed in tango and whatever I wrote down felt incencere like I was trying to sensationalize and spiritualize my hobby. But in the end, I came to realize, I'm just as guilty as succumbing to my lizard brain as an actual lizard running after a fly. My fly is beautiful and elegant women that have dedicated a bunch of their time to their art. I like to be around them. I think my struggle in admitting this stems from not wanting to look vain to myself and to others. But if that's who I was back then, I was better off accepting it and acting it out otherwise I was doomed to be in perpetual denial and stuck there. I started this memoir saying that Unity and Friendship are what tango was for me. That was bullshit too. In telling myself that story, I was simmply complicating Vonnegut's famous Girl-Meets-Boy story arc that we all experience at some point: Boy meets their dream girl, experiences momentary bliss, screws everything up, and then fights for redemption and wins. In my case, it was the same arc except multiply the screws-everytying-up part by a big number. In a late night conversation with a good friend, my soulmate, she retiliated to my statement that women are always looking to change men by saying "no, we are improving you guys. Whenever I meet a guy and he says to me that's he's into pottery or poetry or cooking, I immediately know that he's had experience with women because he's a finer human being. No man in his right mind signs up for pottery classes on his own. There was a woman there." I disagreed profusely, but thinking about it later, I came to realize that in my vain persuit, I had built more character. I was more courageous, more humble, and more honest. As I wrote these words, I felt freed from my delusional shackles. I'm free to go out and just relish the in the female beautiy and be around it. I don't have to camouflage my first reaction to El Flaco's video with more refined tales like I love the dance itself or I'm chasing after a mystical sensation that comes once every blue moon. Those things are true, but they're not my drive. That admission, gave me even more impulse to work harder on my dance to dance with more elegant and refined women and meet more challenges along the way. Once I became honest with myself I could also see a multitude of gifts that tango had been giving me. When I felt lonely, I could go to my neighborhood milonga and just hang there. When I felt like getting laid, I knew which milongas increased my of meeting someone with the same intentions. When I wanted to get inspired, I knew which milonga had top performers. When I wanted to listen to good music, I knew where the best bands played. When I wanted to impress, I knew which milonga had beginners. When I wanted to just dance, I knew which milonga had dancers compatible with me. When I got tired of tango, I knew that it would be there for me when I came back. The only thing that it demanded in return was to tell it exactly what it was that I wanted from it. But the gift that tango will give you no matter what you do and no matter who you are are deep and meaningful friendships. That one is for free.
