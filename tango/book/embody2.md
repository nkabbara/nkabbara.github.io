# Embodying a Dancer

I now made my decision to be a dancer, but how to actually go about becoming a one?

When I looked at the danve floor, some things where obvious that demarvated dancers from non dancers. The most obvious one was that dancers danced. You see them at the dance floor the whole time mobing around in expressive movements and they barely sat. Another thing that was appearant with dancers was that they were free with their bodies. There was nothing mechanical or predetermined in their movements. It looked natural. And a final obvious charactarisic was that the couple looked
 like they were habing fun. Mistakes were laughed at and pretencious movements were a source of pride. The whole thing looked natural.

I set out to imitate the dancers I liked most and it seemed to me that dancing the whole time was the easiest of the three characteristis that I could detect at the time of what made a dancwer a dancer. I thought that by just focusing on that one thing, that new insights will surface and those will lead me to new fand exciting places. As is in my nature to set challenges to my self, I set a weekly quota of at least 20 dances. I only counted dances with new people. Friends didn't count as part of the quota. Whenever I went back home I journaled abount my experience with each dancer and about the milongqa in general. I wqanted to gain insights about how I was behaving. Namely, what was my mind thinking and how did my body feel. I set out to do this in ordre to understand what was it that made me anxious in sonme dances and what was it that made me enjoy myself in others. I felt like I was a bug studying itself under a microscope so I called that period in my debelopment as a dancwer a Bug Called Nash.

The first insight I gained in the Bug era was how nervous I was entering a milonga. I had been to hundreds of them by then, but I never introsected about my experience to notice that. My breath was shallow and irregular, my gaze was choppy and unstable. I started to notice things like that more because xi knew that when ZI gout hoe, I was gng to journal about my ecperiences. I was paying attention. This nervousness also extended to all new experiences in the milonga. My first tanda was my most nervous one. The first song in a tanda was more tense than the following ones. Appearantly there was more work to do with my agoraphobia. Though I figured out how to frequent milongas, there was still an underlying anxiety that i needed to learn how to work wtih. Sine I gained that insight, the first thing I did after xi sat down at a milonga was become concious of my breath and stay with it guiding it into more profound movements. Longer inhales and longer exhales. My mind would fight this and stay in panic mode for a while and also tries to refuse to believe that I was anxious, but after a while, it calmed down matched my breath. That became my first rutual at milongas and also at most social events. This ritual extednded to my embrace. When I got into an embrace the first moments I focused on synbhing our heartbeats to together. I searched for my partners pulse, and conciously breathed until I felt like we were in synch.
