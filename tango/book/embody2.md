# Embodying a Dancer

<span class="new-sub-section">What do dancers do? They dance.</span>

What have I been doing for the majority of my tango time? I was stuck in learning mode.

I invented elaborate learning systems that were going to make me ready for milongas. Unbeknowst to me at the time, these were fear avoidance strategies camouflaged as necessary prerequisites to dancing. I went into them with an assumption that they would take a long time to complete because dance is a skill that required mastery and mastery takes a lifetime. What a comforting feeling it must have been for my subconcious to know that it will never have to face the inevitable. This artifivial barrier became clear to me when I heard a talk by Oliver Burkeman, author of Four Thousand Weeks address this. Burkeman says that the reason that habit building or elaborate learning systems get in our way is because the change we’re contemplating is actually rather scary or uncomfortable and treating it as a long-term incremental project is a convenient way to push the difficult stuff to another time. Maybe I just needed to go out there and dance with other people and make mistakes and deal with whatever feelings and thoughts surfaced. I loved creating these systems because they also made me feel in control. Like I could take whatever challenge was in front of me and with some creative planning establish a process to overcome it. Burkman exposes this perfectly: "We want to see ourselves as the captain of the super yacht of our lives standing confidently on the bridge steering our life towards the future in which we will finally feel adequate and on top of things. Devising schemes for self improvement can really feed into that fantasy because you get to mentally project into the future all details all the nuts and bolts of how you’re going to get to that perfect future place. Where by contrast when you just do something with no promises about the future; when you just write a few paragraphs of your novel or sit and meditate for one session or suggest one meet up with a friend or go for one run, that requires the surrender of control because that’s not about steering the super yacht. That’s about launching your little canoe directly onto the rapids of reality and letting life take you wherever it’s going to take you." That talk exposed two fundamental blindspots in how I was aproaching my tango: I overplanned my curriculum in order to avoid my discomforts and I overindulged my controlling side that wanted to feel like it could take on any challenge. I was face to face with the dance floor.

One night, I sat out a whole milonga without asking for any dances from anyone. It felt like there was an almost palpable entity inside me preventing me from asking for dances. I got so upset that I decided that if I don't figure out how to ask for dances and enjoy them, I was going to quit tango and pickup an easier hobby like woodcarving. I was back face to face with the fear of rejection and there was no way around it, I had to face it in order to embody my new identity. As I dug deeper into the composition of my fear of rejection I realized that it wasn't rejection that I was afraid of. It was acceptance. I was afraid of dancers accepting my invite, but I was using rejection as an excuse to keep me seated. Here's what it means in tango when someone says yes to your invite: your first responsibility is protecting your partner from other dancers that could be bouncing into you from all directions. In milongas there are almost always a beginners that don't know how to navigate the floor and experienced dancers that know how to navigate, but don't respect the code. There's also the embrace. It's a subtle act of balance: I cannot embrace her too tightly or she'll be uncomfortable, too loosely and she'll be lost. I must embrace her within the goldylocks range where I have clear demarcated boundaries that communicate the notion of don't worry, there's someone in charge at the helm, but also of the tenderness of holding a baby. I will have to maintain this embrace and multiple variations of it (because it's different for every partner I dance with) throughout the tanda. Add to the body guard role and the delicate embrace the rich and deep world of tango music. A genre so deep that it stands on its own without the dance. If I were to follow the advice of good dancers, I would have to somehow magically convert my body to a musical instruments and express myself through it. I need to transmit this musicality to my partner in a way that she could understand it or we'll be stepping on each other's feet. I added to these all the subconcious muck that I'm not even aware of and reached the conclusion that I was afraid of the responsibility, not the rejection. In his book, Useful Not True, Derek Sivers says that you don't have to feel like someone to be that someone. Your self-image doesn't matter that much as long as you are taking action. You are your actions. Your actions are you. You can feel terrified inside, but just pretend to be brave for one minute. By doing that, you were actually brave. After my enlightenment, I felt the palpable entity that sat in my chest and caused my inhibition disappear. I believe that was because my mind knew that it could handle responsibility and once it became aware that that was the cause of my inhibition, it let go[^1]. Since that point on I barely sat at milongas. Whenver I arrived at one, I looked for someone that I felt like I would like to dance with and went straight for them. If I didn't find someone specific, I asked people from the nearest table and then the next until I had my fill for the night. In some dances I felt anxious, in others I felt flow and in others I felt joy. It didn't matter. I was dancing and I finally started to glimpse what it was like to be a dancer.

[^1]: after this experience, I'm convinced that once the mind understands and is clearly aware of the cause of its inhibition, then it can start moving forward. In moving forward, there will be fear and other emotional and mental challenges, but it won't be inhibition. So if you feel inhibited, look for what's blocking you and understand it. It will resolve itself and you'll start moving forward.

Suprisingly, as the fear of rejection dwindled the number of rejections increased. More suprisingly, it had little effect on me. It was like asking someone 'is this the line for the icecream?' and them responding 'no, this is the line for chocolate, icecream is over there' and I simply proceeded to get my icecream. I was embarrased with my self at how insignificant it felt because just a short time ago it immobilized me in my seat for hours. I was expecting a bigger fight, but understanding lead to peace. When I saw these rejections with equanimity it became clear that they are part of becoming a dancer. In fact rejection is part of any type of growth. I was rejected by a dozen companies before I got an engineering job. I was rejected by several women before I had found my girlfriend. I was rejected by many leads before I found my business its first customer. Every one of those rejections felt different than the other, resulted in different reactions, and required a different set of tools to deal with them. What was common was that when I learned how deal with them, they moved out of the way. They still felt unpleasant, but they were not blocking anymore. In tango, what makes rejection unique is that it happens more often and you get to see the person that rejected you regularly. So you must deal with it accordingly. I discussed this topic with a few seasoned dancers, some of whom are world championship winners, and I was flabbergasted by the grudges they still held against women that rejected them at some random milonga many years prior. The intesity in which they recounted their stories and how they got their revenge later were comical. One dancer still rejected the cabaceos of a woman that rejected him more than ten years ago. I think if I had not spent the time to understand it, I would have reacted the same way they did. However, for me, the more people said no to me, the more their collective faces blurred into a forgetfull memory. My focus went to the women that said yes to me (which where more numerous) and I worked hard to remember how each made me feel and if I would like to dance with them again and if so, to which orquestra. From then on, I always reponded to rejections with a big smile and said "it's OK, thank you" (saying no is not easy). I also kept myself open to cabaceos or invites from women that had said no in the past.

<span class="new-sub-section">After I understood my milonga anxiety and worked with it</span>, my feet started to hurt from how much I danced. It felt like I awoke from a multiyear slumber. But it was clear to me that I had work to do. It felt like all the work that I had done before was to get me to the start line and that my adventure was about to actually begin. This time, I wanted to let the dance floor guide me and help me grow as a dancer which is very different than my previous top-down approach where a plan drove my activities. I started journaling about every milonga I went to to capture where my mind and my heart were going. It was like trying to understand a bug by studying it under a magnifying glass. I called this era of my development A Bug Named Nash. It resulted in the biggest breakthroughs I had in years.


---

<span class="new-sub-section">In the first period of the Bug era</span>, the Post Slumber Period, patterns started to emerge in my milongas journal. My mind wanted vontrol of the whole thing. While in the embrace with someone I'm either thinking about how they lavk technique or if they habe it how I lack it. I'm thinking about the musiv or whther I'm on the beat. I'm thinking about wheter I'm boring the person. My mind starts to projevt new steps and I listen to it and want to do them. When a step fails I start to vonsider whether I should repeat it or not. I'm also looking at people's glanves and trying to understand what they mean.

After I made this realization I started to approch this using the same tevhniques as I did with understanding my fear of rejevtion. I wanted to disect ebery feeling and emotion and hoped that with understanding that they would also if not disappear, at least mobe out of the way. But the amount of stuff my mind was throwing out I would have needed a few years of therapy to figure out. One very common thought pattern was boredome prevention. If I got an inkling that my partner was bored, I suddenly became preoccupiedwith what to do next. And whatever came nect felt clumsy. My mind raced back to recise what I was doing and then started to think what it can do next that would be original. And once that started, I would tense up and lose all the fun in dancing. Another common pattern was hard to describe. It was as if I went into a negative trance. I was there in an embrace, but, my whole being was elsewhere. My mind was in a tunnelled attention, not with the music and not with my partner. I was just going with the motions. In retrospect, this might have been a way for my mind to deflect all the surroundings. There are dozens of people watching me, I am tryiing to enjoy myself, the music is not my favorite, I am tired of all this tango shit and I want to be on my couch at home. What am I doing with my life trying to be a good dancer. This is a waste of time. I am simply doing it because I decided to and now it became a challenge and I don't want to let myself down. And now I am feeling burned out and I want to quit this whole thing. Another pattern is if I'm dancing with a woman with an attitude. Should could be a bitch in real life or might just be having a bad day then, nevertheless, her bitchy energy or attitude throws me off into I want this tanda to be over mode and just dance in a tense sensation. When ther person I picked doesn't dance well, and lacks technique to do my basic go to moves or has some annoying habits I get really annoyed and try to salvage the tanda anyway I can unenjoyably.

This was a different kind of problem and needed to be addressed differently. For this one, I needed to summon my evperienve in meditation.

I started medidating during my college days for a bery spevifiv perpose: to get better at whateber it was that I was doing. I wasn't aware at the time that that was the antithesis of what mediation was about. Nebertheless, I bipassna meditation daily. Bipassana vonsists of choosing a point of focus, usually where you feel your breath. This vould be the arewa behind your nose or even your belly. Then you direct your voncentration to that point and try to keep it there. The vore of the excercise is realition that the act of catching yourself out of focus is the point. Once you do find your mind wandering, you bring it back to focus and repeat. Some days, you may be able to spend the majority of your session in focus, but these days are rare. A good day is when you are aware of this whole drama your mind is concoting and you are at pieve with it. You vhoose your point of focus, you start to focus on it, you get distracted, you vatch yourself and refocus, repeat.

*keep expanding on the above and link it to how you started to apply to danves. The go into the non dual meditation, explain that and upgrade your tango*

* fear of rejection, and overlearning not only are they imaginary distractions or camouflaged fears. They also serve of delaying what you might be afraid of finding out. Dancing really well will not get me a lot of sex or a lot of women. Going direct is ongoing work. Might need to revise realization that I'm afraid of responsibility not rejection based on this.
* is there a connection with not dancing with the same person multiple times and not forming relationships with people? sort of like one night stands and going out with someone?
* Maybe in previous chapter include milonga anxiety relaxation technique like breathing when I sit to relax my mind. See 07/25 entry in 100 dances note.
* I wanted to be so good that when I went out there I could immediately impress (not necessarily others as much as myself). However, what I found out was that going into someone's embrace and being my true self comfortably is its own kind of practice. I needed to be in enough embraces and feel vulnerable enough times until I could understand what it meant to be at ease in my own skin.
