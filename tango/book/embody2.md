# Embodying a Dancer

<span class="new-sub-section">How does one go about becoming a dancer?</span> I started to answer that question by observing the dance floor and try to extrapolate the charactaristics of the people the danced from th ones that were merely going with the motions. My idea was to find those charactaristics and the put a plan where xi would tackle my finding from easiest to hardest. That would have been standard operation Nash. Break a problem down into its simplest parts and start attacking them one by one until i've attacked the whole. But something didn't feel right about that. I didn't feel like tango could be broken down like an engineering problem and I also felt like my mind was plotting something that I couldn't see clearly. Around that time, I seredepadously heard a talk by Oliver Burkeman, author of Four Thousand Weeks that made it all obvious. Burkeman says that the reason that habit building or elaborate learning systems get in our way is because the change we’re contemplating is actually rather scary or uncomfortable and treating it as a long-term incremental project is a convenient way to push the difficult stuff to another time. Wow. I never considered that my way of approaching problems which was perfect for some parts of my life, could act as a delay mechanism for the things that I was afraid of. I started to look deeper into this hammer of mine to see what else I was using it on and another insight became clear. I loved breaking problems down and creating systems to solve them because they also made me feel in control. Like I could take whatever challenge was in front of me and with some creative planning establish a process to overcome it. Burkman exposes this perfectly: "We want to see ourselves as the captain of the super yacht of our lives standing confidently on the bridge steering our life towards the future in which we will finally feel adequate and on top of things. Devising schemes for self improvement can really feed into that fantasy because you get to mentally project into the future all details all the nuts and bolts of how you’re going to get to that perfect future place. Where by contrast when you just do something with no promises about the future; when you just write a few paragraphs of your novel or sit and meditate for one session or suggest one meet up with a friend or go for one run, that requires the surrender of control because that’s not about steering the super yacht. That’s about launching your little canoe directly onto the rapids of reality and letting life take you wherever it’s going to take you." That talk exposed fundamental blindspots in how I was aproaching my tango for years. It was time to try something different.

It was the simplest thing ever. All I had to do was reverse how I did things. Instead of observing and planning and solving, I just had to dance. Dance a lot. And whenever I faced any challenges, I could decide if these were ones that I wanted to work on or whether I could live with them and still enjoy my dance. Whenever I went back home I journaled abount my experience with each dancer and about the milongqa in general. I wqanted to gain insights about how I was behaving. Namely, what was my mind thinking and how did my body feel. I set out to do this in ordre to understand what was it that made me anxious in sonme dances and what was it that made me enjoy myself in others. The hope here was that if I understood my behavir better, I'd be able to get more of the dances that felt good. I felt like I was a bug studying itself under a microscope so I called that period in my debelopment as a dancwer a Bug Called Nash.

<span class="new-sub-section">The first thing I needed to understand and address before I could dance a lot</span> was the force that kept me seated. My fear of rejection. It could prove to be the thing that would keep me hiding in my comfort zone of lifetime learning and planning. I didn't want that. At least I was sure of that fact.

One night, I sat out a whole milonga without asking for any dances from anyone. It felt like there was an almost palpable entity inside me preventing me from asking for them. That night was the epitome of my fear of rejection and it was to serve as the perfect specimen to help me understand what was going on inside of me. I went home and I started writing. As I dug deeper into the composition of my fear of rejection I realized that it wasn't rejection that I was afraid of. It was acceptance. I was afraid of dancers accepting my invite, but I was using rejection as an excuse to keep me seated. Here's what it means in tango when someone says yes to my invite: my first responsibility is protecting my partner from other dancers that could be bouncing into her from all directions. In milongas there are almost always beginners that don't know how to navigate the floor and experienced dancers that know how to navigate, but don't respect the code. There's also the embrace. It's a subtle act of balance: I cannot embrace her too tightly or she'll be uncomfortable, too loosely and she'll be lost. I must embrace her within the goldylocks range where I have clear demarcated boundaries that communicate the notion of don't worry, there's someone in charge at the helm, but also of the tenderness of holding a baby. I will have to maintain this embrace and multiple variations of it (because it's different for every partner I dance with) throughout the tanda. Add to the body guard role and the delicate embrace the rich and deep world of tango music. A genre so deep that it stands on its own without the dance. If I were to follow the advice of good dancers, I would have to somehow magically convert my body to a musical instruments and express myself through it. I need to transmit this musicality to my partner in a way that she could understand it or we'll be stepping on each other's feet. I added to these all the subconcious muck that I'm not even aware of and reached the conclusion that I was afraid of the responsibility, not the rejection. That was the first I got from studying the Bug.

After my first enlightenment, I felt the palpable entity that sat in my chest and caused my inhibition disappear. I believe that was because my mind knew that it could handle responsibility and once it became aware that that was the cause of my inhibition, it let go. I was embarrassed at how easy it was to get ovedr that hump. While it manifested, it felt like something built into my characted and was impossible to overcome.  Since that point on I barely sat at milongas. Whenver I arrived at one, I looked for someone that I felt like I would like to dance with and went straight for them. If I didn't find someone specific, I asked people from the nearest table and then the next until I had my fill for the night. In some dances I felt anxious and in others I felt joy. It didn't matter. I was dancing and I finally started the journey that would enable me to face fresh challenges.

The first insight I gained in the Bug era was how nervous I was entering a milonga. I had been to hundreds of them by then, but I never introsected about my experience to notice that. My breath was shallow and irregular, my gaze was choppy and unstable. I started to notice things like that more because xi knew that when ZI gout hoe, I was gng to journal about my ecperiences. I was paying attention. This nervousness also extended to all new experiences in the milonga. My first tanda was my most nervous one. The first song in a tanda was more tense than the following ones. Appearantly there was more work to do with my agoraphobia. Though I figured out how to frequent milongas, there was still an underlying anxiety that i needed to learn how to work wtih. Sine I gained that insight, the first thing I did after xi sat down at a milonga was become concious of my breath and stay with it guiding it into more profound movements. Longer inhales and longer exhales. My mind would fight this and stay in panic mode for a while and also tries to refuse to believe that I was anxious, but after a while, it calmed down matched my breath. That became my first rutual at milongas and also at most social events. This ritual extednded to my embrace. When I got into an embrace the first moments I focused on synbhing our heartbeats to together. I searched for my partners pulse, and conciously breathed until I felt like we were in synch. Only then did I start to dance. I accepted that this anxiety might be with me forever and I just needed to learn how to coexist with it in order to reap the pleasures afforded to me when I lose myself. I lost myself when my mind was not there. Connecting with my breath helped acceptijng my anxiety.

My mind liked to go to two places. It wanted to avoid boring my partner at all cost. Whenever I felt a whif that my partner was bored, my mind went into planning mode. It would start to plan a sequence of movements that would create some variety to prevent boring my partner. When that happened, ie my mind has taken over the dance my body tensed up. It was obvious to me and to my partner. I lost flow. It might have succeeded at avoiding boredom, but it definjitely replaced with something worse. It's nearly impossible to keep wth the flow of the music while your mind is plotting a sequence. You lose something fundamental to the dance when you do so.
