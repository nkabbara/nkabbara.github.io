# Embodying a Dancer

<span class="new-sub-section">How does one go about becoming a dancer?</span> I started to answer that question by observing the dance floor and try to extrapolate the charactaristics of the people the danced from th ones that were merely going with the motions. My idea was to find those charactaristics and the put a plan where xi would tackle my finding from easiest to hardest. That would have been standard operation Nash. Break a problem down into its simplest parts and start attacking them one by one until i've attacked the whole. But something didn't feel right about that. I didn't feel like tango could be broken down like an engineering problem and I also felt like my mind was plotting something that I couldn't see clearly. Around that time, I seredepadously heard a talk by Oliver Burkeman, author of Four Thousand Weeks that made it all obvious. Burkeman says that the reason that habit building or elaborate learning systems get in our way is because the change we’re contemplating is actually rather scary or uncomfortable and treating it as a long-term incremental project is a convenient way to push the difficult stuff to another time. Wow. I never considered that my way of approaching problems which was perfect for some parts of my life, could act as a delay mechanism for the things that I was afraid of. I started to look deeper into this hammer of mine to see what else I was using it on and another insight became clear. I loved breaking problems down and creating systems to solve them because they also made me feel in control. Like I could take whatever challenge was in front of me and with some creative planning establish a process to overcome it. Burkman exposes this perfectly: "We want to see ourselves as the captain of the super yacht of our lives standing confidently on the bridge steering our life towards the future in which we will finally feel adequate and on top of things. Devising schemes for self improvement can really feed into that fantasy because you get to mentally project into the future all details all the nuts and bolts of how you’re going to get to that perfect future place. Where by contrast when you just do something with no promises about the future; when you just write a few paragraphs of your novel or sit and meditate for one session or suggest one meet up with a friend or go for one run, that requires the surrender of control because that’s not about steering the super yacht. That’s about launching your little canoe directly onto the rapids of reality and letting life take you wherever it’s going to take you." That talk exposed fundamental blindspots in how I was aproaching my tango for years. It was time to try something different.

It was the simplest thing ever. All I had to do was reverse how I did things. Instead of observing and planning and solving, I just had to dance. Dance a lot. And whenever I faced any challenges, I could decide if these were ones that I wanted to work on or whether I could live with them and still enjoy my dance. Whenever I went back home I journaled abount my experience with each dancer and about the milongqa in general. I wqanted to gain insights about how I was behaving. Namely, what was my mind thinking and how did my body feel. I set out to do this in ordre to understand what was it that made me anxious in sonme dances and what was it that made me enjoy myself in others. The hope here was that if I understood my behavir better, I'd be able to get more of the dances that felt good. I felt like I was a bug studying itself under a microscope so I called that period in my debelopment as a dancwer a Bug Called Nash.

<span class="new-sub-section">The first thing I needed to understand and address before I could dance a lot</span> was the force that kept me seated. My fear of rejection. It could prove to be the thing that would keep me hiding in my comfort zone of lifetime learning and planning. I didn't want that. At least I was sure of that fact.

One night, I sat out a whole milonga without asking for any dances from anyone. It felt like there was an almost palpable entity inside me preventing me from asking for them. That night was the epitome of my fear of rejection and it was to serve as the perfect specimen to help me understand what was going on inside of me. I went home and I started writing. As I dug deeper into the composition of my fear of rejection I realized that it wasn't rejection that I was afraid of. It was acceptance. I was afraid of dancers accepting my invite, but I was using rejection as an excuse to keep me seated. Here's what it means in tango when someone says yes to my invite: my first responsibility is protecting my partner from other dancers that could be bouncing into her from all directions. In milongas there are almost always beginners that don't know how to navigate the floor and experienced dancers that know how to navigate, but don't respect the code. There's also the embrace. It's a subtle act of balance: I cannot embrace her too tightly or she'll be uncomfortable, too loosely and she'll be lost. I must embrace her within the goldylocks range where I have clear demarcated boundaries that communicate the notion of don't worry, there's someone in charge at the helm, but also of the tenderness of holding a baby. I will have to maintain this embrace and multiple variations of it (because it's different for every partner I dance with) throughout the tanda. Add to the body guard role and the delicate embrace the rich and deep world of tango music. A genre so deep that it stands on its own without the dance. If I were to follow the advice of good dancers, I would have to somehow magically convert my body to a musical instruments and express myself through it. I need to transmit this musicality to my partner in a way that she could understand it or we'll be stepping on each other's feet. I added to these all the subconcious muck that I'm not even aware of and reached the conclusion that I was afraid of the responsibility, not the rejection. After my enlightenment, I felt the palpable entity that sat in my chest and caused my inhibition disappear. I believe that was because my mind knew that it could handle responsibility and once it became aware that that was the cause of my inhibition, it let go. Since that point on I barely sat at milongas. Whenver I arrived at one, I looked for someone that I felt like I would like to dance with and went straight for them. If I didn't find someone specific, I asked people from the nearest table and then the next until I had my fill for the night. In some dances I felt anxious and in others I felt joy. It didn't matter. I was dancing and I finally started the journey that would enable me to face fresh challenges.

As the fear of rejection dwindled the number of rejections increased, but suprisingly that had little effect on me. It was like asking someone 'is this the line for the icecream?' and them responding 'no, this is the line for chocolate, icecream is over there' and I simply proceeded to get my icecream. I was embarrased with my self at how insignificant it felt because just a short time ago it immobilized me in my seat for hours. The fear felt like it was part of my character and that there was nothing to do about it. I was expecting a bigger fight, but understanding lead to peace. When I saw these rejections with equanimity it became clear that they are part of becoming a dancer. In fact rejection is part of any type of activity that changes your current behaviour. I was rejected by a dozen companies before I got an engineering job. I was rejected by several women before I had found my girlfriend. I was rejected by many leads before I found my business its first customer. Every one of those rejections felt different than the other, resulted in different reactions, and required a different set of tools to deal with them. What was common was that when I learned how deal with them, they moved out of the way. They still felt unpleasant, but they were not blocking anymore. In tango, what makes rejection unique is that it happens more often and you get to see the person that rejected you regularly. So you must deal with it accordingly. One night I was sitting at a table with a few seasoned dancers and xi took the opportunity to ask them how they dealt with rejection. "One night at la catedral, I saw this beautiful woman sitting close to our table so xi went up and askeed her for a dance. She declined. She had no idea who I was. A little while later, the organixer of the milonga came over to say helljo and he happened to know her. So he introduced us and me as the 2018 world champion. Her eye bulged out and this time she asked me for a dance. I agreed and during the tanda I used every single move in my inventory to give her a taste of what she was missing. She was blown away and the smile on her face linked her two ears together. Later during the night she kept cabaceoing me and I kept pretending that I wasnt seeing her. Eventually she sent over her friend to ask me to dance with her and I told him, thanks, but no thanks. That will show her. That was more than 10 years ago and I still see her at milongas and I still decline her invites." Then every one at the table started recounting similar revenge stories. I was expecting the pros to share their tools with me, however it seemed like none of them have figuired this piece out. That discussion  made me proud because even though my interlocutors surpassed me technically I felt like I was ahead psychologically. I could deal with rejections much better.  For me, the more people said no to my invite, the more their collective faces blurred into a forgetfull memory. My focus went to the women that said yes (which where more numerous) and I worked hard to remember how each made me feel and if I would like to dance with them again and if so, to which orquestra. From then on, I always reponded to rejections with a big smile and said "it's OK, thank you" (saying no is not easy). I also kept myself open to cabaceos or invites from women that had said no in the past.

The bug named Nash could now live happily with rejection.

<span class="new-sub-section">The second insight I gained in the Bug era was how nervous</span> I was entering a milonga. I had been to hundreds of them by then and I worked out how to stay and how to make friends and enjoy myself, but there was an underlying anxiety that never left my body. Physically it manifested itself as shallow and irregular breathing and with choppy and unstable vision. Once I became aware of it, I could also identify similar anxieties in others. Women putting on their dance shoes with shaky hands and men unable to keep eye contact. What keeps us coming back I wondered. What's the matter with us?

What I started doing on arrival to a milonga was to find my seat and before chaning into my dance shoes I connected with my breath. Usually, my lungs were barely doing enough work for me to stay alive. As soon as I became concious of that I ectended my inhales and echales to about six seconds each and my mind would react in opposition. It seemed like it did not want to admit that it was anxious and as it faught that fact, it just became doubly anxious. As I stayed longer with my breath my mind's slowed down and thoughts became more legible. I could clearly see what's occupying my mind. "Are people lookng at me?" "Who's here today?" "I don't want to dance, what am xi dongh here?" "Are there any good dancers?" and an overflow of similar questions passing through my conciousness at immense speed. There was nothing much for me to do other than stay with my breath and wait for reality to kick in. Nostalgic tango music, big smiles on the dance floor and people embracing each other in 9 minute love episodes. Once I got infected with the smile, only then did I change into my dance shoes.

Then came the time for the first dance. Depending on my partner, my heartbeat could range anywhere from 50 to 70 percent over normal ranges. Then as the tanda proceeded and based on how my partner is, it got bach to normal. Somtimes it would take a few dances before it got acclimated and before the fun began. I did not want to deal with so much anxiety before I could truly have fun. What I was looking for was a faster way to connect with people. I wanted the fun and creativity start right from the beginning. I didn't want to have to wait for a long warmup before I could habe fun.  At the same time, if that was the natural way of things, then maybe I had to put in a few tandas before I was allowed to enjoy myself. Maybe that was the price of enjoying a milonga. But I still had a few trick under my sleeve. Especially on the first embrace I started to work on synching my heartbeat with my partner. As soon as we got into an embrace I would start to look for any sign of a pulse whether through her chest in a close embrace or through our points of contact in an open embrace. Once I detected that in her I started to conciously

My mind liked to go to two places. It wanted to avoid boring my partner at all cost. Whenever I felt a whif that my partner was bored, my mind went into planning mode. It would start to plan a sequence of movements that would create some variety to prevent boring my partner. When that happened, ie my mind has taken over the dance my body tensed up. It was obvious to me and to my partner. I lost flow. It might have succeeded at avoiding boredom, but it definjitely replaced with something worse. It's nearly impossible to keep wth the flow of the music while your mind is plotting a sequence. You lose something fundamental to the dance when you do so.
