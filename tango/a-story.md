_How tango, a child of a neighborhood in buenos aires, became a worldwide phenomenon_

Paris, 1920, a well clad 60 year old _inheritor_of_husband's death is looking across the dance into the gaze of a 24 year old latin hot throb.

New York, 1984, a 32 year old accountant is looking across the dance floor into the eyes of a 30 year old fashion designer.

Buenos Aires, 1972, a 65 year old retiree, is looking across the dance floor, into the eyes of a 30 year old arts major.

Buenos Aires, 2024, a 28 year old gorgeous woman is looking into the eyes of 23 year old gorgeous woman.

A few moments after these stares have taken shape, these couples will be on each other, torso to torso, cheek to cheek, fully embraced sweating over each other. Some will be in complete bliss, others with ultirior motives and yet other just need a hug because they haven't hugged been hugged well enough throughout their lives. But for sure ONe half of the pair will be smiling with eyes closed while the other moving her as he wills. They are dancing tango.

Legend has it that this is only possible because more than a century ago  bunch of immigrants landed in Beunos Aires, but their boats were not designed by Noah. This designer packed 3 men for every woman.

* verbally is not the same, physically it is.
* To have a connection for a moment, but then not try to reclaim it or build on it. Just try to enjoy it.
* love your partner body and soul. It's not only moving bodies, it's also moving emotions. Motion and emotion.
