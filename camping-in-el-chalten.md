_Document is work in progress until I return to Buenos Aires._

## Preparation

### Sleep

I'm shifting [my internal clock](/books/internal-time) to be an early riser. Closing apartment shutters at sunset, dimming lights and stopping all screen activities.

### Feet

1. Kahtoola Microspikes.
2. Lem's Waterproof Boulder Grip Boots. Treated with sealant wax and Seam Grip + WP in some areas for extra waterproofing[^1].
3. 2 sets of 3 layers of socks: injinji liner, merino mid, waterproof outer[^2]. Reduce layers based on conditions.
4. Outdoor Research low gaters.
5. Camp: Zeroshoes flipflops with one of the layers above.
5. Sleep: wool socks

[^1]: I submerged these in bathtub for seven minutes. No water entered at fist glance, but the next day, the inner liner and parts of the leather were wet. I've applied treatment since then to improve waterproofing.
[^2]: For waterproof layer, I'm testing waterproof socks, but also got backup trash bags.

### Legs

1. Merino underwear.
2. Synthetic base layer.
3. Breathable joggers.
5. Rain pants.
5. Camp: Use sleep base layer below with joggers if not wet. If wet, use base layer with rain pants.
6. Sleep: second synthetic base layer.

### Torso

1. Synthetic base layer.
2. Fleece grid hoodie.
3. Synthetic puffer.
4. Rain jacket.
5. Wind jacket.
6. Emergency poncho.
7. Camp: Use sleep base layer and alpha hoodie. Use puffer if not wet, rain or wind jacket otherwise.
8. Sleep: second synthetic base layer

### Hands

1. Liner gloves
2. Wool mutton mid layers
3. Water proof outer [^3]
4. Camp: Use sleep liner with puffer gloves
5. Sleep: second liner

[^3]: the current outer shell is too restrictive. Need to get creative here if I can't find them soon.

### Head & Neck

1. Hoodies from mid layers
1. Merino buff
2. Wool cap
3. Synthetic fleece cap [^4]

[^4]: Will probably need to use wind jacket in case of heavy winds to block it.
