As soon as I stepped into the trail head of the Huemul circuit--the most difficul 4-day trek in El Chalten that does not require a guide--I was faced with a steep hill. To distract my mind from the effort it took to reach the top I started thinking of the theme of the trek. Something I had been thinking a lot about since I started my sabbatical is the skill of how to enjoy oneself regardless of your situation. So I named the Huemul trek: The Art Of Contentment. But by the time I finished the circuit something almost palpable changed in me which completely changed the theme I had assigned it at the start.

In 2019 I summoned the courage to escape my comfort zone. After I had bought my house in Houston I had settled into it and into the Houston lifestyle. I had everything fine tuned to my liking: how the trash can opened as to not annoy me, how my food was prepared weekly so I don't have to worry about it during the week and even my social activities were preplanned to where my friends knew if they don't catch me during that window, it's going to take another week to see me.

But there was one thing that couldn't be squared away and tucked into my neat schedule. The allure of living where home truly is. I ended up in Houston not by choice, but by convenience. The question that had always nagged me was what if I could choose my place, where would it be?

And just like that, I sold all belongings that don't fit in suitecases and started my travels.

As I moved from one place to a more alluring and exciting place there was always this subtle expectation that the next place is it. There is where it will be more like home than any other place. But after a few moves what became apparent to me is what I was bringing with me--in addition to all the stuff that fit in suitecases-- is a way of thinking that if not gotten rid off, my travels would turn into a compulsive chase of something that doesn't exist. This pattern of thinking materializes as minor complaints. When doing my yoga in country A, my mind jumps to country's B studio that better fits my needs. It also materializes in more significant subjects like country A's cuisine is terrible compared to country B's; eating is something I do every day.

At the top of the ascent I was bewildered. Day one is supposed to be the easiest of all four days. Fuck, this trek is going to be difficult.

The theme of The Art of Contentment started to change when I committed my first mistake. One section of the trek includes a trail that is sided by the Rio Tunel Glaciar. The map wanted me to walk on the mountain side. I wanted to walk on the glaciar. I saw a section where the mountain seemed to connect with the glaciar and I thought that's my way in. As I tried to go down the mountain, I slipped and slid down until I reached its bottom. About a 200 meter descent. What looked like a connection from afar was a 3 meter gap from close. There was no way for me to get on the glaciar from that point, which I meant I had to walk up a few hundred meters to get back on the trail. This mistake cost me a couple of hours which meant, I'm probably going to arrive to the next camp ground at dark. This is my first mountaineering experience. It's my first time in Patagonia. It's my first cold weather camping experience.

I'm shifting [my internal clock](/books/internal-time) to be an early riser. Closing apartment shutters at sunset, dimming lights and stopping all screen activities.
