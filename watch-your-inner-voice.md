In a conversation with a friend, my inner voice said "oh lord, is this girl for real? Does she really lack that much perspective to even think that?"

While working with a vendor to set the upcoming fees, I made a small mistake with the numbers. My inner voice said "oh lord, how stupid. I can't believe how I couldn't see what's going on."

If you allow your inner voice to use that kind of language towards others, then when you're not paying attention, it will use it on you.

Nurture a kind inner voice[^1].

[^1]: kind, not nice. Kind will tell you that you have lettuce on your teeth. Nice won't tell you because it doesn't want the discomfort.
