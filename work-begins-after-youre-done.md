I started my sabbatical on Dec 21, 2024 and the first thing that I wanted to do was give myself superpowers: Read with heightened comprehension, write with precision, retain information faster, and reframe outdated perspectives.

Reading books is the only way I know of how to do this. I was practically raised by books. Sorry mom.

I limited my selection to five: [How To Read A Book](/books/how-to-read-a-book), [On Writing Well](/books/on-writing-well), [Unlimited Memory](/books/unlimited-memory), [Useful Not True](/books/useful-not-true), and [Internal Time](/books/internal-time). It took me around 3 days to finish reading a ~300 page book inspectionally[^1]. I was so energized by the inspectional reading because of the potential that the book had. But the analytical reading bored me; The novelty was gone and now I was faced with the hard work of deepening my understanding of the author's message. This part took around 2 weeks to finish.

I approached this task like work—I put in an average of 6 hours per day on reading and taking notes—and published my notes as I finished each book. I shared my notes with friends for feedback and accountability. **I read and understood each book, but that wasn't the end of it. It turned out it was just the beginning.**

The real work began after right after I finished the book and published my notes. I had to apply its techniques—altering my habits and discombobulating my comfort zone—in its particular area. Like this article for example, I rewrote it after reading my [On Writing Well](/books/on-writing-well) notes. Obviously I need to reread them many more times.

[^1]: Inspectional and analytical reading are referring to the second and third stages of reading from [How To Read a Book](/books/how-to-read-a-book).
