## Sabbatical

I had been planning to take a sabbatical for several years. My idea was that as soon as my investment income exceeded my expenses with wiggle room for emergencies and unforeseen events, I would hand in my resignation. I reached that milestone in 2023, but it took me all of 2024 to work up the courage to do it. I recalculated my expenses and passive income more than twenty times during that year. I tried to imagine every possible emergency including the need for a sudden epidectomy, improbable lawsuits, and global market collapse. I discussed the idea with close friends from many different angles. I almost started a plan to create funds for emergencies, which would have forced me to stay working for a few more years. But I came to the realization that I was dealing with loss aversion. I wanted to let go of a fat paycheck in a terrible tech market for what? To regain my eight hours a day? Will I be left behind as my friends grew in their careers? Can I do better with my time than my employer could do with it?

I tried to improve my work environment so I would have less to complain about as a last attempt to test how much I really wanted to go on sabbatical. I changed teams to quickly realize that what I had done was not an improvement. By the end of the week, I put in my resignation and there came the final test. The director of engineering on my team offered me a substantial bonus if I were to stay and complete the project at hand. That made me pause and think for about three seconds and I just could not no proceeding with my plan. I recalculated my expenses and passive income for the twenty first time and declined his offer.
