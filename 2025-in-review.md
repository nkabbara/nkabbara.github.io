## Sabbatical

I had been planning to take a sabbatical for several years. My idea was that as soon as my investment income exceeded my expenses with some wiggle room for emergencies and unforeseen events, I would hand in my resignation. I reached that milestone in 2023, but it took me almost all of 2024 to work up the courage to do it. I recalculated my expenses and passive income more than twenty times during that year. I tried to imagine every possible emergency including the need for a sudden epidectomy, improbable lawsuits, and global market collapse. I almost started a plan to create funds for said emergencies, which would have forced me to stay working for a few more years. After discussing what was going on with a few friends I came to the realization that I was dealing with loss aversion. I wanted to let go of a fat paycheck in a terrible tech market and for what? To regain my eight hours a day? Will I be left behind as my friends grew in their careers and wealth? Can I do better with my time than my employer could do with it?

As a last attempt to test the strength of my desire for a sabbatical and to get out of a less than ideal team environment I thought maybe novelty is really what I needed, so I switched teams at work. By the end of that week my desire won so I put in my resignation and with that came the final test. The director of engineering in my new department offered me a substantial bonus if I were to stay and complete the project at hand. That made me pause and think for about three seconds, but I just could not see myself delaying things anymore. I recalculated my expenses and passive income for the twenty first time and declined his offer. I honored my contractual obligation of staying for a couple of months to delegate my responsibilities to a few team members and started my sabbatical on Dec 21st 2024.

As I reflect on the things that I did during this year, the overarching theme was doing all the things that I had always wished I could do if I had the time. The biggest insight I gained was that I had this underlying currant of thought that tricked me into believing that if I did those things then I would feel more fullfilled. I can put that type of thinking away now because the truth is that I am already fullfilled. It's just that I have to remind myself more often about that. I would like the underlying currant of thought be about wonder and curiosity and their consequence of enabling me to see the world differently.

## Books

I spent the first few months of my [sabbatical on books](/work-begins-after-youre-done). I always dreamed of having all the time in world to read books and learn from them, so I started with that. My primary list of books was very meta (e.g. one of the books is titled How to Read a Book), so it made sense to front load that list. What that experience made me realize was that I might have ADHD. I'm able to take on any project and hyper focus on it until I completed it. Even at the expense of my mental health. With my métier, hyper focus is bearable because there are usually multiple context switches throughout the day and different areas that I had to handle in order to get things to production. But with an activity like reading the same subject over multiple weeks then summarizing it and publishing its notes felt heavy on my mind. Especially when the process is repeated over several months. Another realization was that the creative part of my mind and the learning part get tired separately. I can learn for a few hours and produce for a few hours fine, but cannot do either for more than a few hours. This makes me think that I should scratch this dream of reading and learning all day and instead strive to have a balance betweenn producing and learning.

Also, that I should get checked [for ADHD](/a-checklist-runs-my-life).


## Tango

At the end of my reading period, I switched gears to submerging myself in the world of tango. I wanted to frequent milongas all night and not worry about waking up late. Something I had always craved while working. I knew that I was going to face many challenges in tango so I started writing [a book](/tango/book/) with the idea that it would keep me on track and help generate insights as I grew in the dance. Also, if I ever thought to myself in the future, where did I do with myself in 2025, I could always refer back to the book.

My first insight was that my body was not built to stay out late at night at crowded places. I'm highly social, but have low tolerance for stimulation especially at night. When I go out to highly stimulating environments my next day's energy runs at 2/5. I stuck to multiple milongas a week for a full year trying to 'fix' this limitation before I knew what was going on. At first I thought it was performance anxiety, then fear of rejection, then introversion and I addressed every single issue that came up with gradual exposure, until I got to a point where I was comfortable with everything that I thought was incessantly pushing me to go home. I got to a point where when I frequented my regular milonga, I was surrounded with friends and can't keep up with dance requests. People literraly calling me from across the isle to dance with them. As fun as this was, I was not OK with wasting multiple days a week or even one day feeling exhausted. It didn't feel right for my mind nor my body. This meant that I was limited to daytime milongas. I'm currently experimenting with those to see how they'll affect me.

## Ditching Qwerty

My third attempt to ditch Qwerty stuck this time. What kept making me going back to Qwerty was how much work was involved in switching layouts. I have so much muscle memory around Vim and Keyboard Maestroy shortcuts that the initial slowdown of a switch would have degraded my work performance. This time, I didn't have any external obligations that I had to abide by so I kept at it everyday since September putting in at least 30 minutes a day on keybr.com and on Monkeytype. As of December, I'm starting to get 40wpm at 98% accuracy on the graphite layout. On Jan 1st 2026, I'm going graphite cold turkey with all my keyboards. That's going to be fun!
