## Sabbatical

I had been planning to take a sabbatical for several years. My idea was that as soon as my investment income exceeded my expenses with some wiggle room for emergencies and unforeseen events, I would hand in my resignation. I reached that milestone in 2023, but it took me almost all of 2024 to work up the courage to quit. I recalculated my expenses and passive income more than twenty times during that year. I tried to imagine every possible emergency including the need for a sudden epidectomy, improbable lawsuits, and global market collapse. I almost started a plan to create funds for said emergencies, which would have forced me to stay working for a few more years. After discussing my hesitation with a few friends, I came to the realization that I was dealing with loss aversion. I wanted to let go of a fat paycheck in a terrible tech market and for what? Are the eight hours that I would gain more valuable to me than what I was charging for them? Can I do better with my time than my employer could do with it? Will I look back in regret a year from now?

As a last attempt to test the strength of my desire for a sabbatical and to get out of a less than ideal team environment I thought maybe novelty is really what I needed, so I switched teams at work. By the end of that week my desire won so I put in my resignation and with that came the final test. The director of engineering in my new department offered me a substantial bonus if I were to stay and complete the project at hand. That made me pause and think for about three seconds, but I just could not see myself delaying things anymore. I recalculated my expenses and passive income for the twenty first time and declined his offer. I honored my contractual obligation of staying for a couple of months to delegate my responsibilities to a few team members and started my sabbatical on Dec 21st 2024.

Reflecting on the things that I did during this year, the overarching theme was doing all the things that I had always wished I could do if I had the time. The biggest insight I gained was that I had this underlying currant of thought that tricked me into believing that if I did those things then I would feel more fullfilled. I can put that type of thinking away now because the truth is that I am already fullfilled. It's just that I have to remind myself more often about that. I prefer that the underlying currant of thought be about wonder and curiosity and their consequence of enabling me to see the world with more understanding.

## Books

I spent the first few months of my [sabbatical on books](/work-begins-after-youre-done). I always dreamed of having all the time in the world to read books and learn from them, so I started with that. My primary list of books was very meta so it made sense to front load that list. What that experience made me realize was that I'm able to take on any project and hyper focus on it until I completed it. Even at the expense of my mental health. With reading, I was focusing on one subject for several weeks, then publishing my notes on it, and then picking up the next subject and repeating the process. By the end of a couple of months, I didn't want to read anything anymore. It seemed like the creative part of my mind and the learning part get tired separately. I can learn for a few hours and produce for a few hours fine, but cannot do either for more than that. For me to be the most energinzed, I have to have a mix of learning and producing during the day. With my craft, hyper focus is bearable because there are usually multiple context switches throughout the day between learning and producing so I rarely felt any burnout.

I should probably get checked [for ADHD](/a-checklist-runs-my-life).


## Tango

When I finished reading my list of [books](/books) around April, I switched gears to submerging myself in the world of tango. I wanted to frequent milongas all night and not worry about waking up late. Something I had always craved while working. I knew that I was going to face many challenges in tango so I started writing [a book](/tango/book/) with the idea that it would keep me on track and help generate insights as I grew in the dance. It would also serve as a memoire that I could revisit in the future. I thought I could finish it before the end of the year, but that was an arbitrary deadline not grounded in what it takes to learn tango. When I reached the chapters on musicality and technique, I realized that these two areas will require a lot more work and time before I can have anything substantial to write about. I've developed a way to track my progress as I work on other projects that I think will help me finish the book by June.

One insight from my journey so far is that my body was not built to stay out late at night at crowded places. I'm highly social, but have low tolerance for stimulation especially at night. When I go out to stimulating environments my next day's energy runs at 2/5. I stuck to multiple milongas a week for a full year trying to 'fix' this before I understood what was going on. It got to a point where some nights I was surrounded with friends at milongas and couldn't keep up with dance requests. People literraly calling me from across the isle for dances. As fun as this was, I was not OK with dealing with the next day's sluggishness. It didn't feel right for my mind nor my body and I could see the danger of being stuck in that lifestyle for years. I'm going to experiment with daytime milongas going forward. It's interesting how sometimes our phisiology is not compatible with what we we want.


## Ditching Qwerty

My third attempt to ditch Qwerty stuck this time. What kept making me going back to Qwerty was how much work was involved in switching layouts. I have so much muscle memory around Vim and Keyboard Maestroy shortcuts that the initial slowdown of a switch would have degraded my work performance. This time, I didn't have any external obligations that I had to abide by so I kept at it everyday since September putting in at least 30 minutes a day on keybr.com and on Monkeytype. As of December, I'm starting to get 40wpm at 98% accuracy on the graphite layout. On Jan 1st 2026, I'm going graphite cold turkey with all my keyboards. Fun!
