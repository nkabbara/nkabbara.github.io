## Sabbatical

I had been planning to take a sabbatical for several years. My idea was that as soon as my investment income exceeded my expenses with some wiggle room for emergencies and unforeseen events, I would hand in my resignation. I reached that milestone in 2023, but it took me almost all of 2024 to work up the courage to quit. I recalculated my expenses and income more than twenty times during that year. I imagined every possible emergency including the need for a sudden epidectomy, improbable lawsuits, and global market collapse. I contemplated starting a fund for said emergencies, which would have forced me to stay working for a few more years. After discussing my hesitation with a few friends, I came to the realization that I was dealing with loss aversion. I wanted to let go of a fat paycheck in a terrible tech market and for what? Are the eight hours that I would gain more valuable to me than what I was charging for them? Can I do better with my time than my employer could do with it? Will I look back in regret a year from now?

As a last attempt to test the strength of my desire[^1] I sought novelty, so I switched teams at work. By the end of that week my desire won so I put in my resignation and with that came the final test. The director of engineering in my new department offered me a substantial bonus if I were to stay and complete the project at hand. That made me pause and think for about three seconds, but I just could not see myself delaying things anymore. I recalculated my expenses and passive income for the twenty first time and declined his offer. I honored my contractual obligation of staying for a couple of months to delegate my responsibilities to a few team members and started my sabbatical on Dec 21st 2024.

[^1]: I'm skipping over a lot of detail including deteriorating team and company-wide moral that had been going on for months.

The beginning of the sabbatical was highjacked with a couple of heavy feelings: The first was that I was being left behind by my friends who were still making tons of money and moving forward in their careers. The second was this sense of lack of structure and having no one to report to. I poured over my journal to address the first and put things into perspective. The escape velocity from the gravity money is immense, but once you're out, it feels like escaping a make believe world that you had been living in your whole life. It feels like a whole section of your brain has been freed up. How will I use it? This is something that I will think about more as the months pass by, but I think I'll just keep doing what I have always done, but with a source of motivation that is not money. For the second, I had to build my own structure, something that I had done before when I built my first company. It had been a while since I switched from being an entreprenuer to working in the corporate world, but it was easy respawn the old habits.

Reflecting on the things that I did during this year, the overarching theme was doing all the things that I had always wished I could do if I had the time. The biggest insight I gained was that I had this underlying currant of thought that tricked me into believing that if I did those things then I would feel more fullfilled. I can put that type of thinking away now because the truth is that I am already fullfilled. It's just that I have to remind myself more often about that. I prefer that the underlying currant of thought be about wonder and curiosity and their consequence of enabling me to see the world with more vitality.


## Books

I spent the first few months of my [sabbatical on books](/work-begins-after-youre-done). I always dreamed of having all the time in the world to read books and learn from them, so I started with that. My primary list of books was very meta so it made sense to front load it. What that experience showed me was that I'm able to take on any project and hyper focus on it until I completed it. Even at the expense of my mental health. With reading, I was focusing on one subject for several weeks, then publishing my notes on it, and then picking up the next subject and repeating the process. By the end of a couple of months, I didn't want to read anything anymore. It seemed like the creative part of my mind and the learning part get tired separately. I can learn for a few hours and produce for a few hours fine, but cannot do either for more than that. For me to be the most energinzed, I have to have a mix of learning and producing during the day. With my craft, hyper focus is bearable because there are usually multiple context switches throughout the day between learning and producing so I rarely felt any burnout.

Thinking about the day to day effects of reading those books more than eight months ago I can say that it was a productive activity. I read differently than I used to. I'm more critical of my writing and congnizant of the importance of brevity. And I can remember certain category of things much better than before (people names and numbers). I also took detailed notes that I can refer to in order to refresh my memory.

In the future, I would interlace reading non-fiction with a related activity that I'm invovled in so theory and practice go hand in hand. E.G. I would read On Writing Well as I was writing my book, not as a prerequisit to writing my book. Get messy quick and organize later.

## Tango

When I finished reading my list of [books](/books) around April, I switched gears to submerging myself in the world of tango. I wanted to frequent milongas all night and not worry about waking up late. Something I had always craved while working. I knew that I was going to face many challenges in tango so I started writing [a book](/tango/book/) with the idea that it would keep me on track and help generate insights as I grew in the dance. It would also serve as a memoire that I could revisit in the future. I thought I could finish it before the end of the year, but that was an arbitrary deadline not grounded in what it takes to learn tango. When I reached the chapters on musicality and technique, I realized that these two areas will require a lot more work and time before I can have anything substantial to write about. I've developed a way to track my progress and insights as I work on other projects that I think will help me finish the book by June 2026.

I started going to my favorite milongas every week for a full year without the pressure of having to leave early. It got to a point where some nights I was literally surrounded with friends and couldn't keep up with dance requests. As fun as this was, the next day I was barely functional, operating with low energy and a bad mood. I couldn't get myself to write nor practice until the following day. My body is not built to stay out late at crowded places. I'm highly social, but have low tolerance for stimulation especially at night. I had always been that way, but forgot about it because my lifestyle naturaly adapted to my body. But with my sabbatical, I was putting myself in new environments and situations that I hadn't in many years. I'm not comfortable exchanging a few hours of fun with 24 hours of discomfort even though I got used to it. This limits my dancing to daytime milongas and dancing with friends outside of socials.

I went through multiple teachers this year trying to find one that I felt I could trust to make me a better dancer and whose teaching style fit my learning style. My formula was to take ten classes with each teacher to get a deep feel for how they taught. After the tenth class, I had to make the hard decision to move on if neither of these conditions were met. It was hard moving on from these relationships because even though many didn't fit my criteria, they were wonderful people with whom I felt some obligation to keep going. Luckily, in October I accidentally stumbeled on a teacher that exceeded my expectations and I have a feeling that I'll be under his mentorship for a long while.

I spent a lot of time on exploring musicality. I took a musicality course that broke down musical elements in tango music. Followed by a musical plays course that layered steps on top of the musical patterns. Both were useful in showing what's possible, but I realized that I didn't have the technique to express them. I spent a lot of time working with teachers that couldn't tell me nor show me what was missing for me to reach that level of expressiveness. Once I learned with the help of my teacher that I had to rewire my body to be able to reach those levels, my focus was redirected to technique. I landed on a book called The Tango Manual that helped me organize my body and how it related to technique in categories which could be worked directly.

Whenever I felt like I had enough material to complete a chapter in my memoire, I stopped all learning and poured into writing. At first I thought that the earlier chapters would be the hardest because they dealt with psychological hurdels and exploring my weaknesses and natrual disposition. I felt vulnerable writing them. I imagined the later chapters that deal with the dance itself would be easier and more tutorial-like. I was wrong because developing the technique required to dance well takes a lot of time and practice. I could not write about a subject that I cannot show at least some level of considerable ability in it.

The year was mostly an exploratory year in which I finally started to understand the structure of tango, how to find a good teacher and how much more work I had to do in order to enjoy myself more in the dance.

So what's next for tango?

* I plan to finish the memoire in 2026


## Ditching Qwerty

My third attempt to ditch Qwerty stuck this time. What kept making me going back to Qwerty was how much work was involved in switching layouts. I have so much muscle memory around Vim and Keyboard Maestroy shortcuts that the initial slowdown of a switch would have degraded my work performance. This time, I didn't have any external obligations that I had to abide by so I kept at it everyday since September putting in at least 30 minutes a day on keybr.com and on Monkeytype. As of December, I'm starting to get 40wpm at 98% accuracy on the graphite layout. On Jan 1st 2026, I'm going graphite cold turkey with all my keyboards. Fun!

## Switching to Lua config on Neovim

I never stopped coding during my sabbatical. I always found excuses to build some stuff for fun. I've come to accept that software development above all else is the thing that I enjoy doing the most. I switched from vim to Zed then to neovim. I updated my .vimrc to the latest and greatest. My plan for the beginning of 2026 is to complete my [terminal plugin](https://github.com/nkabbara/onmyterm.nvim) as a way to break in the graphite layout (in extremem anger).
