- Your goal when you're typing is for accuracy and your way of getting more accurate is to be very interested in the upcoming word and how it feels in your fingers. How do your hands move as you type it. Have no concern for speed.
- The name of the game if concentration. You have to figure out how you can concentrate while typing. For me it's the above and asking my eyes to look at the next word when I feel like I have the current one down.
- Extreme patience is required. Whatever you think is the most patient you've been in your life, double it and it would probably not be enough
- Some voyager notes:
  - had to add thumb rests to remove thumb pain
