- Your goal when you're typing is for accuracy and your way of getting more accurate is to be very interested in the upcoming word and how it feels in your fingers. How do your hands move as you type it. Have no concern for speed.
- Extreme patience is required. Whatever you think is the most patient you've been in your life, double it and it would probably not be enough
