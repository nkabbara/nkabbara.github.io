## Challenges in completing this

* Impatience. You want to finish it quickly. You do not want to take your time. Be here in the moment.

## What's my goal in taking notes here?
I want to read books better so that I become more wise and a better reader and therefore a better person. Put a book in my lap, give me the required time and I'll get to its level.

## How To Take Notes for this Book?

Start with extermely important first level rules, before the steps of inspectional, analytical and syntopical reading. These come from the last section of the last chapter. Pick them from there. And as you process your notes, add to them.

Then for inspectional reading, list the rules and then explain each of the rules. Same for other types of reading.

So headings for the notes would be

It's hard to categorize notes as I'm processing them. How about this:
1. Read a chapther highlights only (except for last one that is worth a reread)
2. Extract them into your own language if they're worth it. (rememver raw notes will be there anyway)
3. When done with chapter, categorize them into the sections below.

### Basic Rules
### How Not to Lose what we've learned here
### Basic Questions that must be always asked
### Inspectional Reading Guide
#### Issues observed
   - Impatiently going throug the book not knowing what's going on just to complete it
### Analytical Reading Guide
#### Real World Difficulties in applying these rules.
  - Discuss how hard it was for you to do this
  - Then how you did it.

--- Started reading analytical. Let's organize as follows
1. Lay out the rules reworded
2. Explain every rule in detail according to its notes

The challenge here is that there are segways from the rules into other subject. For example he goes into the reciprocal ard of writing and reading in the middle of the unity of the book section. We don't want to take notes on that while working on analytical notes so we have to be sure to come back to those sections if necessary when we're done.

I. The first stage of analytical reading: Rules for finding what a book is about

1. Classify the book according to kind and subject matter.
2. State what the whole book is about with the utmost brevity.
3. Enumerate its major parts in their order and relation, and outline these parts as you have outlined the whole.
4. Define the problem or problems the author has tried to solve.

II. THE SECOND STAGE OF ANALYTICAL READING: RULES FOR INTERPRETING A BOOK’S CONTENTS
5. Come to terms with the author by interpreting his key words.
6. Grasp the author’s leading propositions by dealing with his most important sentences.
7. Know the author’s arguments, by finding them in, or constructing them out of, sequences of sentences.
8. Determine which of his problems the author has solved, and which he has not; and of the latter, decide which the author knew he had failed to solve.

III. THE THIRD STAGE OF ANALYTICAL READING: RULES FOR CRITICIZING A BOOK AS A COMMUNICATION OF KNOWLEDGE A. General Maxims of Intellectual Etiquette
9. Do not begin criticism until you have completed your outline and your interpretation of the book. (Do not say you agree, disagree, or suspend judgment, until you can say “I understand.”)
10. Do not disagree disputatiously or contentiously.
11. Demonstrate that you recognize the difference between knowledge and mere personal opinion by presenting good reasons for any critical judgment you make. B. Special Criteria for Points of Criticism
12. Show wherein the author is uninformed.
13. Show wherein the author is misinformed.
14. Show wherein the author is illogical.
15. Show wherein the author’s analysis or account is incomplete.

Note: Of these last four, the first three are criteria for disagreement. Failing in all of these, you must agree, at least in part, although you may suspend judgment on the whole, in the light of the last point.

We observed at the end of Chapter 7 that applying the first four rules of analytical reading helps you to answer the first basic question you must ask about a book, namely, What is the book about as a whole? Similarly, at the end of Chapter 9, we pointed out that applying the four rules for interpretation helps you to answer the second question you must ask, namely, What is being said in detail, and how? It is probably clear that the last seven rules of reading—the maxims of intellectual etiquette and the criteria for points of criticism—help you to answer the third and fourth basic questions you must ask. You will recall that those questions are: Is it true? and What of it?
