I adopted [Shams El Tabriz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shams_Tabrizi) aka Shamsito in Puerto Vallarta, MX in October 2019. My friend Daisy called me up and said that she found the cat for me at a mall where they were running an adoption thing. We met there to check him out a couple of hours later, but they told us that he's back at the rescue. It took us more than an hour to reach the rescue. It was up the mountains in a tiny town overlooking Vallarta.

Since then he's traveled with me to Guadalajara, MX and Buenos Aires, AR.

When I adopted him I was reading a lot of [Rumi](https://a.co/d/gEBjteP). That's where his name came from. His original name was Whisky.

He's awesome. I love him.
