My recent camping adventures required that I pickup a few knots for various tasks. This is my reference.

## Nomenclature
1. **Standing end**: the longer end of the rope.
2. **Tail end**: the shorter end of the rope where most of the tying activity takes place.
3. **Loop**: a round or oval structure made with the rope.
4. **Bight**: a U-shaped structure made with the rope. You get this if you stop before completing the loop.
