My recent camping adventures required that I pickup a few knots for various tasks. This is my reference for the ones that I have memorized.

## Nomenclature
1. **Standing end**: the longer end of the rope.
2. **Tail end**: the shorter end of the rope where most of the tying activity takes place.
3. **Loop**: a round or oval structure made with the rope.
4. **Bight**: a U-shaped structure made with the rope. You get this if you stop before completing the loop.

## Basics
_I learned [these](https://www.animatedknots.com/basic-knots) because they teach you the underlying principles of knots. Some of them are components of other more complex knots._

1. **Half Hitch**
2. **Half Knot**
3. **Square (Reef) Knot**
4. **Overhand Knot**
5. **Sheet Bend**
6. **Figure 8**
7. **Slip Knot**
8. **Noose Knot**

## Camping

1. **Bowline End Loop**: Securly tie a rope around an object or around a loop.
2. **Automatic Trucker's Hitch**: Tie tent guielines to objects or stakes especially when there isn't enough rope to get back.
4. **McCarthy Knot**: Tie tent guilines when there's enough rope to come back to bowline knot or base of standing end.
3. **Figure 8 Bend**: tie two ropes of same size together securely.
5. **Quick Release Jamp Knot**: tie down blankets and tents for packing. Or a bunch of wood collected for burning.
6. **Coil Unattached Rope**: Putting rope away for later use.

I still need knots for the following scenarios:
* Tying a loaded rope
* Tying food to a tree


## Notes
