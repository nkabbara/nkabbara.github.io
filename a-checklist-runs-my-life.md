Without a checklist I wonder aimlessly. I do what's necessary to move along. I start things and never finish them. I tend to feel anxious, purposless and at loss.

With a checklist, I have a quest[^1] and I know the exact steps that I need to do everyday in order to journey through it.

[^1]: I've been using 'quest' instead of 'goal' because it makes my work feel continuous. It's not something I'll get to, but rather it's something I'll go through and keep it with me.

Whenever someone becomes privy to my checklist system, their immediate reaction is to think that it's robotic and controlling[^2]. I started to have a similar feeling about it for a while just because I've heard it so many times, but now that I'm thinking more about it, **I've come to realize the it's actually my way to be at my best.**

[^2]: I'm using their own words.

The core items in my checklist are routine tasks that I do regularly like excercise, meditation, and journaling among others. These tasks put me in top shape to be a better person for the people around me and also make tackling my quest items more effective. Quest items are context specific tasks that are based on what I'm currently working on. For example, my current quest is to write better. In order to do that, I've selected five books to read [analytically](/books/how-to-read-a-book) and publish [their notes](/books) on my site. So my quest items look something like this:
* ...
* Work on book for 2 hours before lunch.
* ...
* Work on book for 3 hours before yoga.
* ...

Over the years, I've changed my checklist system many times to where I think I have it tuned in pretty well for my disposition. I can think of a few things that make it endure as I myself change.

**Easy to create**: It must take less that a minute to spawn a checklist from a template that has 80% of all items filled in. Then another 10 to 15 minutes to fill in quest items. This is for the whole week. Planning shouldn't happen more than once a week[^3].

[^3]: Though modifying the plan is natural and happens throughout. The plan is the ideal, I don't expect to hit the ideal every day.

**The Free Week**: Every six weeks[^4], I take a week off from the checklist in order to distance myself from the work I'm doing and to have a wider perspective on things. I'm free to work on other stuff or the same stuff in different ways or even just binge on movies for a week. Everything is on the table including abandoning the whole thing. This does a couple of things for me, one, it makes me appreciate my system and how it had been helping me out. And second, it gives me a break from the system because it does start to feel tiring after sevearl weeks.

[^4]: I arbitarilty picked six weeks. I might change this one day.

**Flexibility**: There's always a conversation going on between the world and the checklist. It shapes my world, but my world also shapes it. As I sprint through the weeks, the routine starts to become too rigid. Unplanned events feel like a major annoyance. What I started to do in these cases is rewrite the checklist to compensate. For example, my mom decided to come and spend a week with me in Argentina. My first reaction was: fuck, I'm going to lose 30 hours of work. My second reaction was: let's make that week's checklist all about showing her the best time of her life and plan work around her resting time where possible. This removes the friction I usually feel when there's a mismatch between what I had planned and what's happening[^7].

[^7]: In the old days, I used to keep my plan the same and figure out how squeeze unplanned events within it.

Using this system I have built a few companies, learned to speak Spanish, learned Tango, got my toastmaster's certificate, and did many challenging things that had I not been able to break down a vision into checklist items, I might have had a harder time going for it.

But also, because I couldn't fit in that date with the beutiful girl, I might have lost a chance at eternal love. Because I declined tons of invites over the years that didn't have a spot on my checklist, I might have lost out on awesome friendships.

Be wise. Know when to let the world take precedence over the checklist.
