## Year In Review

I'm writing out my [year in review](/2025-in-review) and publishing sections as I finish them.

## Tango

My time in tango had always been at the periphery. When I look back at how my involvement in it has shaped my life and my relationships I wonder what would happen if I gave it more. This year I stopped wondering and went all in. I'm writing a memoir as I explore its profundity which is surprisingly acting as a guide that is helping me overcome many challenges.

[Chapter three](https://nashkabbara.com/tango/book/) is out! Currently doing research (i.e dancing and studying a lot more) as I work on finishing the book with chapters 4 and 5 and appendix A. 

## Voyager Keyboard

I bought my <a href="https://www.zsa.io/voyager">Voyager keyboard</a> in Oct, 2023 and never had the time to break it in. At first, I decided to quickly migrate to it by loading qwerty on it, but then I looked at some [videos comparing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNeYmr48JUM) qwerty with modern layouts and I was shocked at how much wrist and finger movement is involved with qwerty. So I decided to learn [graphite](https://github.com/rdavison/graphite-layout). I'm using [keybr](https://www.keybr.com/) to memorize the keys and then will use [MT](https://monkeytype.com/) to get me to 60-80 wpm.

**Update:** I <a href="https://www.keybr.com/profile/82hl9uj">finished</a> memorizing all of the graphite alphanumeric characters and some the most common symbols. Currently working on improving my accuracy on Monkeytype using the English 200 at 98% accuracy. On Jan 1st, I'm going to switch all my keyboards cold turkey. It's going to be painful for a couple of months.

## Neovim & Lua

I had been on the same .vimrc for years and recently decided to convert to init.lua to catch up to <a href="https://neovim.io/">neovim's</a> latest features. It's been tons of fun. I'm currently writing my <a href="https://github.com/nkabbara/onmyterm.nvim">own terminal plugin</a> to go deeper into nvim's ecosystem. Also giving <a href="https://github.com/neovide/neovide">neovide</a> a go while I'm at it.
