## Year In Review

Here's how my [2025 went](/2025-in-review).

## My First Neovim Plugin

I'm currently writing my <a href="https://github.com/nkabbara/onmyterm.nvim">own floating terminal plugin</a> to learn neovims's API. I'm doing this on SUPER hard mode because I'm using [a new keyboard layout](https://github.com/rdavison/graphite-layout). I'm literally mapping missing symbols as I need them and then writing them on a sticky note to remember them. It feels excruciatingly painful and I'm getting tired much sooner than I usually do when coding. This has been an eye opener at how much effect one's setup has on cognitive load. It's forcing me to rethink my workflow and shortcuts to be more seamless.


## Graphite Layout

I've switched my work computer to [graphite](https://github.com/rdavison/graphite-layout) on Jan 1st. I'm currently at around 40wpm (98% accuracy), but inconsistently. I'm using the <a href="https://www.zsa.io/voyager">Voyager</a> keyboard as my main driver and mapping my home row mods as I go. Once I have this keyboard stabilized, I'll switch my personal laptop to graphite as well using [Kanata](https://github.com/jtroo/kanata).

Why have I decided to make my life temporarily miserable? I saw [videos comparing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNeYmr48JUM) qwerty with [modern layouts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKQ4pOoFh5I) and I was shocked at how much wrist and finger movement is involved with qwerty. It's an experiment to see how a new layout will affect my typing experience and my interaction with my computers.

## Tango

My time in tango had always been at the periphery. When I look back at how my involvement in it has shaped my life and my relationships I wonder what would happen if I gave it more. This year I stopped wondering and went all in. I'm writing a memoir as I explore its profundity which is surprisingly acting as a guide that is helping me overcome many challenges.

[Chapter three](https://nashkabbara.com/tango/book/) is out! Currently doing research (i.e dancing and studying a lot more) as I work on finishing the book with chapters 4 and 5 and appendix A.
