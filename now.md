## Tango

My time in tango had always been at the periphery. When I look back at how my involvement in it has shaped my life and my relationships I wonder what would happen if I gave it more. This year I stopped wondering and went all in. I'm writing a memoire as I explore its profundity which is surprisingly acting as a guide that is helping me overcome many challenges.

I've recently completed the first [two chapters](https://nashkabbara.com/tango/book/). My current focus is on chapter three: On Being Musical.

## Voyager Keyboard

I bought my <a href="https://www.zsa.io/voyager">Voyager keyboard</a> in Oct, 2023 and never had the time to break it in. At first, I decided to quickly migrate to it by loading qwerty on it, but then I looked at some [videos comparing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNeYmr48JUM) querty with modern layouts and I was shocked at how much wrist and finger movement is involved with qwerty. So I decided to learn [graphite](https://github.com/rdavison/graphite-layout). I'm using [keybr](https://www.keybr.com/) to memorize the keys and then will use [MT](https://monkeytype.com/) to get me to 60-80 wpm.

Update (2025/10/22): I have <a href="https://www.keybr.com/profile/82hl9uj">8 more letters</a> to memorize! My plan is to switch all my keyboards to graphite before the end of the year and get to 40wpm at 97% accuracy.

## Neovim & Lua

I had been on the same .vimrc for years and recently decided to convert to init.lua to catch up to <a href="https://neovim.io/">neovim's</a> latest features. It's been tons of fun. I'm currently writing my own terminal plugin to go deeper into nvim's ecosystem. Also giving <a href="https://github.com/neovide/neovide">neovide</a> a go while I'm at it.
