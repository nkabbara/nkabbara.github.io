## Tango

My time in tango had always been at the periphery. When I look back at how my involvement in it has shaped my life and my relationships I wonder what would happen if I gave it more. This year I stopped wondering and went all in. I'm writing a memoir as I explore its profundity which is surprisingly acting as a guide that is helping me overcome many challenges.

[Chapter three](https://nashkabbara.com/tango/book/) is out! Currently doing research (i.e dancing and studying a lot more) as I work on finishing the book with chapters 4 and 5 and appendix A.

## Voyager Keyboard

I bought my <a href="https://www.zsa.io/voyager">Voyager keyboard</a> in Oct, 2023 and never had the time to break it in. At first, I decided to quickly migrate to it by loading qwerty on it, but then I looked at some [videos comparing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNeYmr48JUM) qwerty with modern layouts and I was shocked at how much wrist and finger movement is involved with qwerty. So I decided to learn [graphite](https://github.com/rdavison/graphite-layout). I'm using [keybr](https://www.keybr.com/) to memorize the keys and then will use [MT](https://monkeytype.com/) to get me to 60-80 wpm.

Update (2025/11/22): I have <a href="https://www.keybr.com/profile/82hl9uj">5 more letters</a> to memorize! I'm altering my strategy after discussing my progress with the reddit hive-mind by lowering keybr's speed threshold to 25wpm and starting with monkeytype immediately (with punctuation and numbers). The idea is that the last few letters on keybr are the least used in English and that I should start with real world vocab now to speedup the switch. The amount of brain pain this project is causing is way higher than I expected. I'm glad I'm at a point of no return.

## Neovim & Lua

I had been on the same .vimrc for years and recently decided to convert to init.lua to catch up to <a href="https://neovim.io/">neovim's</a> latest features. It's been tons of fun. I'm currently writing my <a href="https://github.com/nkabbara/onmyterm.nvim">own terminal plugin</a> to go deeper into nvim's ecosystem. Also giving <a href="https://github.com/neovide/neovide">neovide</a> a go while I'm at it.
