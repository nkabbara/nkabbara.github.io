## Tango

My time in tango had always been at the periphery. When I look back at how my involvement in it has shaped my life and my relationships I wonder what would happen if I gave it more. [I'm going to give it more](/tango).

## Voyager Keyboard

I bought my Voyager keyboard in Oct, 2023 and never had the time to break it in. Since last week, I'm up to 50 wpm with alpha characters and plan to cover symbols and numbers in the upcoming couple of weeks. In fact, I wrote this update on it. My impression so far is that ortholinear is far more comfortable and much easier to navigate. I discovered that Kailh Choc Browns cause my left shoulder to hurt. Blues don't seem to cause any pain. I'll test out reds before settling on the blues. I'm curious about how this will change my VIM experience.
