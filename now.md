## Year In Review

Here's how my [2025 went](/2025-in-review).

## My First Neovim Plugin

I released my first <a href="https://github.com/nkabbara/onmyterm.nvim">neovim plugin!</a> I built it to learn neovims's API and Lua and to battle test the graphite keyboard layout. But it fit my needs so much that it's now my daily terminal manager. I love neovim so much more now that I got a true taste of extending it and customizing it to my needs.

The most exciting thing that happened during this project was that it gave me a chance to <a href="https://github.com/nickjvandyke/opencode.nvim/pull/139">contribute to open source</a>, further expanding my lua and neovim knowledge. I was using <a href="https://opencode.ai/">opencode</a> through a neovim plugin and noticed that it had no native way of switching sessions, which meant that I har to cycle through windows, issue the right commands then switch back to the window that I was working in. A flow killer. I submitted a PR that solves the problem reusing the same patterns of the plugin making the process nearly seamless. The <a href="https://github.com/nickjvandyke">creator</a> of the project was very accommodating and nice making the process delightful.


## Tango

I finised [chapter three](https://nashkabbara.com/tango/book/) of my tango memoir! I'm currently doing research for chapter 4, titled The Centimeter. It's about technique. The research is in the form of learning and applying and codifying technique. I'll move to the writing stage once I have enough material and stories for the chapter. Tango takes about 2 hours a day from me in a combination of private lessons, solo practice, partner practice and daytime milongas.

## Reading & Listening

I started listening to the massive and wonderful [The Story of Civilization](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B074CF5NP9?binding=audio_download&ref=dbs_m_mng_rwt_sft_taud_tkin) series by Will Durant. There's more than 500 hours of listening in there.

I'm currently reading the following books:
* [Food Rules by Michael Pollan](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002YJK5L4) [done]
* [Practical Vim by Drew Neil](https://www.amazon.com/Practical-Vim-Edit-Speed-Thought)
* [Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat: Mastering the Elements of Good Cooking](https://a.co/d/eq1Kj2l)

## Graphite Layout

I've switched my work computer to [graphite](https://github.com/rdavison/graphite-layout) on Jan 1st. I'm currently reaching 44wpm (98% accuracy) and more easily completing 60s runs, but inconsistently. I'm using the <a href="https://www.zsa.io/voyager">Voyager</a> keyboard as my work computer driver and for my other computers I am using [Kanata](https://github.com/jtroo/kanata) to remap my [keyboards](https://github.com/nkabbara/dotfiles/blob/main/dot_config/kanata/leisure.kbd). I 100% vouch for Kanata. Amazing software.

Why have I decided to make my life temporarily miserable? I saw [videos comparing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNeYmr48JUM) qwerty with [modern layouts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKQ4pOoFh5I) and I was shocked at how much wrist and finger movement is involved with qwerty. Now, whenever I try to type qwerty, it feels complicated.

I'm typing daily on Monkeytype for at least 15 minutes working my way from English 200 to English 10K. I'll stop this when I can average 80wpm at 98% accuracy for the last 10 uninterrupted lessons. I have symbols and numbers turned on. I move up a level when I can finish a language setting at 40wpm/98% for average of last 10 successful sessions. Whenever I get bored of Monkeytype, I switch do [burst-type](https://www.burst-type.pro/)
