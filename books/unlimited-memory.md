Since high school, I had been memorizing by rote repetition. It turns that that's the least effective way to memorize. Actually, it's blatantly incorrect. Our mind is setup to memorize in very specific ways and if practiced, then our ability to retain data blows up significantly. There's work upfront, but the downstream energy savings are worth it.

The first step in approaching this method is to drop your excuses, usually they're the form of self assigned limitations: helplessness, blaming others, needing external help (outside the book), stress, etc...If you believe your limits, your life will be very limited. So start out by assuming that your memory is limitless. Use [Useful Not True](/books/useful-not-true) notes for more on this.

As you practice this method, catch where your memory is doing things right [^1]. Learn to see how it's serving you every day and its future potential to serve you more. Journal about this regularly. Mention the slips and how you can improve them as well.

## The first C: setting up the mental space

Peace and concentration are the same thing. Conflict pulls your mind in many directions; it is the opposite of concentration. In order to harvest concentration, you'll need to first take control of your inner voice: Help it generate useful and encouraging thoughts. When it generates self hatred and conflict, catch that and deal with it directly, don't let them fester.

Second, stop multitasking. When working on memorizing, that's the only thing you should be doing[^2]. Screens off, etc...

Third, be sure you have a very clear idea of why you're memorizing the material at hand. Is it to impress someone? To build expertese in a specific area? To learn a language? Use the PIC principle: Purpose: keep the purpose front of mind the whole time. The more specific the more it will help you concentrate on the data. Interest: Attention deficits are mostly interest deficits. Your mind never wanders; it moves toward more interesting things. So learn how to generate interest by linking what you're learning and memorizing to how it will affect the physical world, i.e. find a direct link between the material and your goal. Curiosity: ask motivational questions that pique your curiosity so you dig deeper into the data. How much capable will memorizing this make me? What's the limit? Will show me new ways of doing things?

Finally, eliminate worry. You don’t worry because you care; you worry because that is what you have learned to do. Worry is a creative mental process. By asking yourself “what if” questions, you set your mind up to worry. If you consistently ask, “What if I lose my job?” “What if I crash my car?” “What if criminals attack me?” then you will create “movies” in your mind that constantly loop those scenarios and cultivate a state of worry. Rather, say to yourself, “What would I do if I lost my job?” or “What would I do if I crashed my car?” The movies created by these questions don’t loop you into worry. They give you action steps that direct your mind. Create a procedure for different scenarios and make peace with your thinking.

Learn to practice peace, because if you have no attention you have no retention.

## The Second C

## Raw Notes

This book teaches you how to memorize. Improving your memory and concentration is not only about what you need to do more of; it is also about what you need to do less of.
We excuse ourselves into living mediocre lives.

Richard Bach said, “Argue for your limitations and sure enough, they’re yours.”

Imagine there is an Earth 1 and an Earth 2. They're duplicates. There's a duplicate of you as well. Same DNA, parents, environment, same everything except beliefs. One uses self limiting beliefs while the other uses growth beliefs. Fast forward 5 years.

In other words, we believe what we have been taught to believe, and we don’t question beliefs because we don’t want to question the source. Begin to ask yourself, “Who will I come to doubt by changing my beliefs about my mind, concentration, and memory? Why do I think this belief is true?”

You were younger then, had less experience, and did not have the ability to question authority. Now you can question his or her judgment of your younger self. Ask yourself questions like, “How much is this belief going to cost me if I hold on to it? Do I have to hold on to it? Is it true? Can I be 100 percent certain that it is the truth?

Remember that the limits in your belief system will always stop you from seeing any alternatives that could otherwise be obvious.

First, remember that 80 percent of changing anything is about why you want to change and only 20 percent is about how you do it.

Your beliefs are the stories about yourself that you have accepted to be true … so you can decide to change the stories.

“Beliefs are not tattoos, they are just like clothes—you can put them on and take them off at will.”

We live in an activity illusion and think that “busyness” is equal to good business, but it’s often just procrastination in disguise.
