Since high school, I had been memorizing by rote repetition. It turns out that that's the least effective way to memorize. Our mind is setup to memorize differently. This books showed me how.

If I believed my limitations, then my life will be bounded by them. So step zero is to assume that my memory is limitless. Use [Useful Not True](/books/useful-not-true) notes for help on this.[^2]

[^2]: if you need motivation and guidance specific to memory work, reread the first three chapters of Unlimited Memory.

## The first C: Setting Up the Mental Space

You need to have a very specific purpose for why you're memorizing the material at hand. Is it to impress someone? To learn a language? To learn the basics of some field then create or excel in it?  With a clear purpose, you'll eat the material up. Without one, boredom will take over. Use the PIC principle[^1].

More dangerous than boredom is worry. Worry is the opposite of peace and you need peace of mind to concentrate. **Eliminate worry** then come back to memorize [^3].

[^3]: You don’t worry because you care; you worry because that is what you have learned to do. Worry is a creative mental process. By asking yourself “what if” questions, you set your mind up to worry. If you consistently ask, “What if I lose my job?” “What if I crash my car?” “What if criminals attack me?” then you will create “movies” in your mind that constantly loop those scenarios and cultivate a state of worry. Rather, say to yourself, “What would I do if I lost my job?” or “What would I do if I crashed my car?” The movies created by these questions don’t loop you into worry. They give you action steps that direct your mind. **Create a procedure for different scenarios and make peace with your thinking.**

[^1]: PIC principle: Purpose: keep the purpose front of mind the whole time. The more specific the more it will help you concentrate on the data. Interest: Attention deficits are mostly interest deficits. Your mind never wanders; it moves toward more interesting things. So learn how to generate interest by linking what you're learning and memorizing to how it will affect the physical world, i.e. find a direct link between the material and your goal. Curiosity: ask motivational questions that pique your curiosity so you dig deeper into the data. How much capable will memorizing this make me? What's the limit? Will show me new ways of doing things?


Learn to practice peace, because if you have no attention you have no retention.

## The Second C: Creativity

Sound is the least effective way to remember because it's sequential and our mind is not wired attach sounds to other memories. So repeating a sound and hoping it sticks is not how to memorize.

### SEE Principle

Mind images and mind movies are the most effective because they involve all five senses. So I'm going to use the SEE principle to memorize. Senses (S): I will use all my senses when creating images or movies of what I want to remember. Exageration (E): I will exagerate what I'm imagning. It wont' be a life sized banana. It will be a banana so big it touches the moon. Energize (E): I'll make the images move, act in illogical ways: weave, crash, stick, or wrap things together to help me remember them. Make things talk, sing, and dance. The moon squashes the banana.

Most abstract words can also be made into mental pictures. Just use a meaningful thought or word to represent an abstract word. Find a word or phrase that sounds the same as or similar to the abstract word, or break up the word into its individual sounds.

Examples of how I can remember Spanish words:

* Cat is gato. Imagine saying to your friend, "You’ve **got to** hold my **cat**."
* Chicken is pollo. You can imagine playing **polo** with a **chicken** instead of a ball.
* Tiger is tigre. It sounds like “tea gray.” To perfect the pronunciation, imagine a **tiger** drinking **tea** that has turned **gray**.
* Sun is sol. Imagine that the **sun** is burning the **sole** of your foot.
* Jewel is joya. Imagine the **joy** **Ana** experienced because of the **jewel** that you gave her.
* Inventar is invent. Imagine a Phoenician on his boat saying "To **invent** the letter **r** (inventar) was hard work."
* Liviana is light. Imagine traveling **light** with **Livi** (Olivia) & **Ana**.
* Stage is etapa. Imagine Brad Pit eating **tapa(s)** on a **stage**.
* Gancho is hook. Imagine a cartoon cowbow with a huge **hooked** nose loading his **gun** with **chorizo**.

I did five words on my own here and got stuck at one for more than 15 minutes [^4] and it feels taxing already. Though as I worked on more words, I started to feel like my imagination was improving. I can see this becoming much easier with more practice.

[^4]: Challenge is Desafío. I couldn't come up with an image for this.

**Imagination first:** at first I was verbally matching words, but noticed better success by alternating between imagining and verbal matching. For example, for Gancho, I was first trying to think what sounds like gancho (gan cho, g ancho, etc...), but then switched to picturing a hook in my mind and suddently I started to see a fishing hook, then a big hooked nose, etc... from there I built the example. Every word in any language is only a picture drawn with letters.

**The picture or movie are what we're after:** I noticed that after I came up with the images above, I started to memorize them by ear as usual. This defeats the purpose of what I'm learning here. Instead, picture the images and movies in your head using all senses. Exagerrate the keywords. SEE principle.

_After doing this exercise, I feel like I haven't actively used my imagination in a long time. This exercise will have many benefits in all areas of thought related work. Thinking using imagination and actively linking already feels super powerful._

## Raw Notes
Nouns are easy to remember and therefore easier to control. Abstract words are harder.

This book teaches you how to memorize. Improving your memory and concentration is not only about what you need to do more of; it is also about what you need to do less of.
We excuse ourselves into living mediocre lives.

Richard Bach said, “Argue for your limitations and sure enough, they’re yours.”

Imagine there is an Earth 1 and an Earth 2. They're duplicates. There's a duplicate of you as well. Same DNA, parents, environment, same everything except beliefs. One uses self limiting beliefs while the other uses growth beliefs. Fast forward 5 years.

In other words, we believe what we have been taught to believe, and we don’t question beliefs because we don’t want to question the source. Begin to ask yourself, “Who will I come to doubt by changing my beliefs about my mind, concentration, and memory? Why do I think this belief is true?”

You were younger then, had less experience, and did not have the ability to question authority. Now you can question his or her judgment of your younger self. Ask yourself questions like, “How much is this belief going to cost me if I hold on to it? Do I have to hold on to it? Is it true? Can I be 100 percent certain that it is the truth?

Remember that the limits in your belief system will always stop you from seeing any alternatives that could otherwise be obvious.

First, remember that 80 percent of changing anything is about why you want to change and only 20 percent is about how you do it.

Your beliefs are the stories about yourself that you have accepted to be true … so you can decide to change the stories.

“Beliefs are not tattoos, they are just like clothes—you can put them on and take them off at will.”

We live in an activity illusion and think that “busyness” is equal to good business, but it’s often just procrastination in disguise.
