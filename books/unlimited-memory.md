Since high school, I had been memorizing by rote repetition. It turns out that that's the least effective way to memorize. Our mind is setup to memorize differently. This books showed me how.

If I believed my limitations, then my life will be bounded by them. So step zero is to assume that my memory is limitless. Use [Useful Not True](/books/useful-not-true) notes for help on this.[^2]

[^2]: if you need motivation and guidance specific to memory work, reread the first three chapters of Unlimited Memory.

## The first C: Setting Up the Mental Space

You need to have a very specific purpose for why you're memorizing the material at hand. Is it to impress someone? To learn a language? To learn the basics of some field then create or excel in it?  With a clear purpose, you'll eat the material up. Without one, boredom will take over. Use the PIC principle[^1].

More dangerous than boredom is worry. Worry is the opposite of peace and you need peace of mind to concentrate. **Eliminate worry** then come back to memorize [^3].

[^3]: You don’t worry because you care; you worry because that is what you have learned to do. Worry is a creative mental process. By asking yourself “what if” questions, you set your mind up to worry. If you consistently ask, “What if I lose my job?” “What if I crash my car?” “What if criminals attack me?” then you will create “movies” in your mind that constantly loop those scenarios and cultivate a state of worry. Rather, say to yourself, “What would I do if I lost my job?” or “What would I do if I crashed my car?” The movies created by these questions don’t loop you into worry. They give you action steps that direct your mind. **Create a procedure for different scenarios and make peace with your thinking.**

[^1]: PIC principle: Purpose: keep the purpose front of mind the whole time. The more specific the more it will help you concentrate on the data. Interest: Attention deficits are mostly interest deficits. Your mind never wanders; it moves toward more interesting things. So learn how to generate interest by linking what you're learning and memorizing to how it will affect the physical world, i.e. find a direct link between the material and your goal. Curiosity: ask motivational questions that pique your curiosity so you dig deeper into the data. How much capable will memorizing this make me? What's the limit? Will show me new ways of doing things?


Learn to practice peace, because if you have no attention you have no retention.

## The Second C: Creativity

Sound is the least effective way to remember because it's sequential and our mind is not wired attach sounds to other memories. So repeating a sound and hoping it sticks is not how to memorize.

### SEE Principle

Mind images and mind movies are the most effective because they involve all five senses. So I'm going to use the SEE principle to memorize. Senses (S): I will use all my senses when creating images or movies of what I want to remember. Exageration (E): I will exagerate what I'm imagning. It wont' be a life sized banana. It will be a banana so big it touches the moon. Energize (E): I'll make the images move, act in illogical ways: weave, crash, stick, or wrap things together to help me remember them. Make things talk, sing, and dance. The moon squashes the banana.

Most abstract words can also be made into mental pictures. Just use a meaningful thought or word to represent an abstract word. Find a word or phrase that sounds the same as or similar to the abstract word, or break up the word into its individual sounds.

Examples of how I can remember Spanish words:

* Cat is gato. Imagine saying to your friend, "You’ve **got to** hold my **cat**."
* Chicken is pollo. You can imagine playing **polo** with a **chicken** instead of a ball.
* Tiger is tigre. It sounds like “tea gray.” To perfect the pronunciation, imagine a **tiger** drinking **tea** that has turned **gray**.
* Sun is sol. Imagine that the **sun** is burning the **sole** of your foot.
* Jewel is joya. Imagine the **joy** **Ana** experienced because of the **jewel** that you gave her.
* Inventar is invent. Imagine a Phoenician on his boat saying "To **invent** the letter **r** (inventar) was hard work."
* Liviana is light. Imagine traveling **light** with **Livi** (Olivia) & **Ana**.
* Stage is etapa. Imagine Brad Pit eating **tapa(s)** on a **stage**.
* Gancho is hook. Imagine a cartoon cowbow with a huge **hooked** nose loading his **gun** with **chorizo**.

I did five words on my own here and got stuck at one for more than 15 minutes [^4] and it feels taxing already. Though as I worked on more words, I started to feel like my imagination was improving. I can see this becoming much easier with more practice[^5].

[^4]: Challenge is Desafío. I couldn't come up with an image for this.
[^5]: Use actual images using drawing software if a concept or word is proving hard to memorize.

**Imagination first:** at first I was verbally matching words, but noticed better success by alternating between imagining and verbal matching. For example, for Gancho, I was first trying to think what sounds like gancho (gan cho, g ancho, etc...), but then switched to picturing a hook in my mind and suddently I started to see a fishing hook, then a big hooked nose, etc... from there I built the example. Every word in any language is only a picture drawn with letters.

**The picture or movie are what I'm after, not words and voice:** I noticed that after I came up with the images above, I started to memorize them by ear as usual. This defeats the purpose of what I'm learning here. Instead, picture the images and movies in your head using all senses. Exagerrate the keywords. SEE principle.

_After doing this exercise, I feel like I haven't actively used my imagination in a long time. This exercise will have many benefits in all areas of thought related work. Thinking using imagination and actively linking already feels super powerful._

### Car Method

The SEE principle is the basic building block to remember bits of information. But in order to remember this information long term, we need to organize it in our mind. We do so by using something that's already in our long term memory (LTM) and organize the short term memory (STM) items on it.

Superior organization leads to superior learning and memorization.

I'm going to test this out on my bike since I don't have a car, but usually, you'd use your car and past cars to do so. What I want to memorize is the **Adopt What Works For You Now** section of [Useful Not True](/books/useful-not-true). This method respects order so it can be used for ordered items like I'm doing below.

    <figcaption>Adopt What Works For You Now - Useful Not True</figcaption>
</figure>

1. How to Decide and Make the Best Choice: No choice is the best in itself. It becomes the best when you choose it. We start on the rack, with an image of a signpost with a hand pushing the button to make the choice final, therefore the best.
2. From Explorer to Self Leader: After choosing, you need to switch from explorer to leader leading yourself. All you know now is: Here's where I'm going. Here's why. Here's how. Let's go! I chose an image of an explorer that we don't need anymore so he's not on the bike, but he's switched to Pres Lincoln the Leader sitting on the seatpost leading himself on the bike.
3. No New Instructions For The Computer: As a leader, stop taking in instructions or you'll never finish the job. On the bike's frame an image of data with stop sign to remind the Pres to stop thinking and start acting.
4. Private Journal to Internalize it: journal to strengthen the choice we made by stacking up reasons (here's how this will help me or others), clarify it so we can explain it to others in 10 seconds, plan it with specific actions so we can execute, picture yourself how you'll be after the road is taken, prepare for future self that will try to revert you to your old self. On the steering pouch we have a journal showing inside it an arm (strengthen), a clear glass (clarify), a todo list (plan), a camera (picture) and a scoutmaster (prepare).
5. Talk with Friends To Solidify it: We know ourselves through others. They might see an angle or consequence you hadn't considered. In the front bag an image of me talking to my friends that I keep in my bag.
6. Why Your Choice is Wrong: Some of your friends or aquaintances will tell you you're wrong. It's not what they need. It's not what people around them do. But this is only for you and only for now. No need to argue that it's true. You'll probably do something else in a few months or years. On front wheel, an image Dwight from the office says you're wrong, but he's overlayed with a here-now buddha to remind us that this is for us and only for now.
7. Take The First Step Immediately: Taking action tests your thought in reality. Do it now! Unless it's something that could hurt you or others long term then sleep on it for a while before rolling. On the pedal (momentum), I have a clapperboard with a camera film to show action and it's on the pedal to show that we need to take the first step to start momentum.
8. Keep Tuning and Adjusting: Return to the journal regularly, revise previous thoughts, talk with friends again, make adjustments. Sometimes you'll need to adjust the plan, other times you only need to adjust your thoughts. Use your wisdom to decide. The image of the piano that needs regular tuning is resting on the chain.
9. You are What You Pretend to Be: You are your actions. Your actions are you. Your self-image doesn't matter as much. When you realize what you need to do, it doesn't mean that's who you need to be. You can just pretend, but do it and with required regularity. I chose an image of a sheep turning into a wolf[^6] standing on the gearbox (movement, momentum, change of pace). He's axed so many actions over and over until he started to convert into one.

[^6]: I'm altering the intended meaning here of wolf in sheep's colthing.

When visualizing something to memorize it, always use as few pictures as possible to remember as much as possible. The simpler and clearer the picture is, the less overwhelmed you will feel.

After creating this image, I have these items in memory already! This actually works!

The theory is LTM + STM = Medium Term Memory (MTM). If you review MTM items (in 2 days, 5 days, 1 week, 2 weeks, 4 weeks, 6 weeks) they'll start converting to LTM and then you can use those new LTMs to store new MTMs on them!

### Body Method

This method is similar to how the vehicle method works, but uses your body. Great for info that you need at your fingertips, remembering shower ideas and such. This is also great to keep track of ideas or main points in a book I'm reading in order to discuss it with friends later or understand the author's structure or handle the first part of an [analytical reading](/books/how-to-read-a-book).

> Just make sure you connect the body part and the information in a humorous way (remember the SEE principles), and that you remember the order. I like to use this system so that I can consistently have the information at my fingertips—literally!

You may store up to 50 bits of info using this method.

Organizing info into compartments, allows future information to be associated with what you have in memory enabling to compare and contrast more effectively. Even slot new information into the relevant compartments.

### Peg Method

You can use any list that is already in your long-term memory to create all kinds of new peg lists. You can make up words and images for each letter of the alphabet (e.g., apple, bucket, cat, dolphin), the months of the year, subway stops on your way to work—any list that you can remember in order.

#### Rhyming Pegs

1. One -> bun
2. Two -> shoe
2. Three -> tree
2. Four -> door
2. Five -> hive
2. Six -> sticks
2. Seven -> heaven
2. Eight -> gate
2. Nine -> vine
2. Ten -> hen

Going to try these on "Traits of Useful Perspectives" chapter in [Useful No True](/books/useful-not-true)

1. Direct: find a more efficient path to the real end result, no need for the middle steps. Why am I starting a business, for freedom? Can I get the freedom that I'm picturing in my mind without starting a business? Picturing myself buying a BUN of bread directly from the baker, not through the supermarket.
2. Energizing: many smart & boring perspectives come to mind, but which one tickles you enough to get you bolting through the streets? Even makes you afraid, but excited. Imaging myself excitedly looking for my lost running SHOE so I can bolt through the street.
3. Self-reliant: process not outcome. Does not depend on anything out of my control. I'm looking at a TREE doing its thing. It doesn't need me or any person to take of it. It's not reliant on any one. Just needs nature and it can thrive.
4. Balancing: prioritize what's been neglected. Me time vs. social time. Exploring vs self leading. I'm imaging a locked DOOR keeping me inside and I really need to get out to balance my recent reclusion.
5. Selfless: my issues are insignificant compared to other people's when I look at them from the outside. How can I help and be useful to others? I'm picturing a bee selflessly and happily (with a bee smile) serving the HIVE.
6. Selfish: I care for myself and I respect myself. It comes out of my self worth. It would take many pages to list all that I've done for others and for myself. I'm proud of that. In order to protect that, I'll smack anyone with multiple STICKS that threatens the goose.
7. Lucid and lasting: am I acting from an emotion? Like envy, jealousy, anger, hurt. Does it still make sense in a couple of weeks after all emotions have subsided, even ecstatic ones? I'm imagining the moon, our trusty HEAVENly body stoicly turning around our planet not missing a beat during our storms neither during our good weather.
8. Test first: before quitting, take a break. Before buying something test it, multiple times if necessary. I'm picturing myself creating a test GATE in the ci/cd of my project to prevent releases that don't pass tests.
9. Healthy: Do what's wise and good even if I don't feel good. Ask the better me, what would I do? I'm picturing a grape **VINE** giving me healthy and nourishing grapes for my monring snack.
10. Long term: Serve the future. I'm just in a phase now. I'll be 80 soon. Some discomfort now for a better future is worth it. I'm picturing a **HEN** forcing herself to sit on the eggs so they may hatch and then forcing her habints into being a good mother HEN in order to spread her genes into the future.
11. Compensating for bias and predjudice: If I tend to walk away, choose to stay. When prejudince against something, learn more and deeply about it until you understanding it. Your defaults might be inccorrect. 11 rhymes with 7 so we have a conflict. In numerology they call it the first master number, so let's use that as a hook. I'm imagining a _master_ sitting with a whip watching over the 10 previous attributes and making sure _there is no bias and prejudice_ taking place.

Really see each link picture in your mind and make it clear. You should now know these attributes forward, backward, and in random order.

The rhyming peg method can be extended by finding additional words that rhyme with the number, e.g.: one—bun, gun, sun. With this method, you can easily create a peg system to store up to 30 bits of new information.

You can use any list that is already in your long-term memory to create all kinds of new peg lists. You can make up words and images for each letter of the alphabet (e.g., apple, bucket, cat, dolphin), the months of the year, subway stops on your way to work—any list that you can remember in order. Enjoy using this method and finding new ways to improve it.

### Shape Pegs

The second peg method, the shape system, converts numbers into concrete shapes. It works in the same way as the rhyming peg method, only this time the pegs are shaped like the number. We are not going to do an exercise with this system, because you have already learned the principle in the rhyme list. The shape method just gives you another option.

## Journey Method

Here’s how it works:
1. Prepare in your mind an organized location, such as a house layout, a shopping mall, or the route you take from your house to the mall.
2. Create markers or places in this location or along the route, as we did with the body and car lists. Use an easy-to-follow order.
3. Using the SEE principles, make a clear image of the information that you want to remember.
4. Place each item you are trying to remember on one of the marked locations.

In short, it is as simple as finding a place or route in your mind to store the information. This system makes remembering large amounts of information as easy as remembering a trip to the nearest shop. You are using the LTM + STM = MTM formula again.

Make sure that your markers are in an easy-to-follow order. Then review them to make sure you have clear storage compartments. The markers should be near each other, but nicely spaced out so that each item you want to remember is placed in a unique memory file in your mind.

Example:
> Here is a mental map of four rooms in my house and 12 places that we will use:
> * Room 1 Kitchen: 1–dishwasher, 2–fridge, 3–stove
> * Room 2 TV room: 4–chairs, 5–TV, 6–exercise bike
> * Room 3 Bedroom: 7–mirror, 8–closet, 9–bed
> * Room 4 Bathroom: 10–bath, 11–shower, 12–toilet

The above should allow to store 12 concepts. You can modify the items in the rooms or rooms to make it match your list.

You can use this system to remember any amount of information—mountains of it.

Review the list backward and you will notice that it will all still be there. Doing this makes the images even clearer for your memory.

This method helps you see the big picture as well as zoom in on details. It brings concepts to life and makes them concrete.

Every memory master uses this method more than any other. It is extremely effective because you can make thousands of storage places. Think about how many markers you can make. You have visited many places in your life; you can use buildings, museums, schools, shopping malls—almost any location that you know. Make sure to choose places you know well, that have significance for you, and that have lots of variety. You can make routes as long as you want; you can have a place or route for every subject you are learning. Remember to have fun!

If you look for them, you will find thousands and thousands of places just waiting to be used in your mind. There are no limits to this system, only limits in your own thinking.

> I find this method to be the most effective of all the memory systems.

Once the information is in a memorable matrix, it helps long-term storage and use by attracting more information to it.
