## Notes

Your process of writing doesn't matter as long as it produces words. Even your subject matter doesn't matter. What matters is writing that shows your humanity to the reader: what drew you to the subject? What baggage are you bringing along? How did it change you?

Simple writing to strip every sentence down to its simplest form. Here's how to achieve it
1. Strip all useless words.
2. Shorten long words.
3. Remove redundant adverbs.
4. Convert passive construction to active construction.
4. Disambiguate sentences that can be read in multiple ways.
5. Unify pronouns in a sentence.
6. Unify tense in a sentence.
7. Clarify who is talking to who when action takes place.
8. Make sure sentence B, logically follows sentence A.
9. Check usage of words you're not sure about.

Simplicity test:
* What am I trying to say?
* Then ask, have I said it?
* Is it clear for someone encountering the subject for the first time?

Be grateful for any word that you can remove or shorten. Clutter removes simplicity. Clutter examples:
1. At this point in time, present time, presently, currently, at this juncture of maturization: now
2. Head up, face up, free up, order up: unecessary propositions
3. Personal friend, personal doctor, personal feelings
4. Experiencing
5. Depressed socioeconomic area, waste-disposal personnel: political correctness gone amok
7. Negative cashflow position
8. Assistance: help
9. Numerous: many
10. Facilitate: ease
11. Individual: man or woman
12. Remainder: rest
13. Initial: first
14. Implement: do
15. Sufficient: enough
16. Fire off: send
15. Attempt: try
16. Referred to as: called
16. With the possible exception of: except
17. Due to the fact that: because
19. He totally lacked the ability: he couldn't
20. Until such time: until
21. For the purpose of: for
17. Paradigm, parameter, prioritize, potentialize: jargon
18. I might add, it should be pointed out, it is interesting to note.
20. Tall skyscraper: known fact
21. Smile happily: redundancy
22. A bit, sort of, in a sense.
23. A whole sentence that repeats the previous one in a different way.
23. Greats, notables: adjectives used as nouns.
23. to host, enthuse, emote (latter two are nouns chopped off), beef up, put teeth into (latter two are padded): nouns used as verbs.[^1]
23. Shouldered his way, only to be met, crashing into his face, waging a lonely war, corruption that is rife, sending shock waves, NY Finest: clich√©s.

[^1]: I noticed that looking up alternatives forces you to be more precise: to entertain, to accomodate, to feed.

Clutter test:
* Is every word doing new work?
* Can any thought be expressed with more economy?
* Is anything pompous, pretensious or faddish?
* Are you hanging on to something because you think it's beautiful?

Stripping down your prose to the essential improves your carpentry. It does not hinder your style. Your style is when you're being yourself with relaxed confidence using good carpentry. Your style is when you are not trying to impress nor indulge the reader.

You owe the reader good carpentry. But you do not owe him your identity. You are using good carpentry in order to show your identity clearly. If the reader leaves because a sentence is illogical, it's on you. But if he leaves because he doesn't think you're funny, it's on him. You owe yourself your honest identity: that's what it means to say you are writing to yourself.

Words are the atoms of writing. To write well, you must:
1. Know the gradiations between synonyms
2. Read the masters, pick a model and ask why did they use this word? Why did they write this sentence like so? How can I write like that?
3. Try to write with your ears and always read your drafts aloud. Pay attention to rhyming, alliteration, cadence and sonority of each sentence.
    * Reassemble the sentence so it ends with a phrase that momentarily lingers.
    * Choose one word after the other because I'm after a certain emotional effect: serene v.s tranquil
    * Gain variety by reversing the order of the sentence
    * Substitute a word that has freshness and oddity. That is oblique, not 'true and tested'.
    * Alter the length of sentences with the occasional short ones.
