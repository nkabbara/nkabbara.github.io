Writing is an act of Ego. Just admit it and use its energy to propell you.

## Top Five Things

1. Write clear, simple and brief English. Do so by removing all clutter. Do so by learning the carpentry of writing.
2. b
3. c
4. d
5. The quality of your article is proportional to the amount of material you've collected. Interviews and research.


## Notes

Your process of writing doesn't matter as long as it produces words. Even your subject matter doesn't matter. What matters is writing that shows your humanity to the reader: what drew you to the subject? What baggage are you bringing along? How did it change you?

Simple writing is stripping every sentence down to its simplest form. Here's how to achieve it:
1. Remove all useless words.
2. Shorten long words.
3. Remove redundant adverbs and adjectives.
4. Convert passive construction to active construction.
4. Disambiguate sentences that can be read in multiple ways.
5. Unify pronouns in a sentence.
6. Unify tense in a sentence.
7. Clarify who is talking to who when action takes place.
8. Make sure sentence B, logically follows sentence A.
9. Check usage of words you're not sure about.

Simplicity test:
* What am I trying to say?
* Then ask, have I said it?
* Is it clear for someone encountering the subject for the first time?

Be grateful for any word, sentence, paragraph, or section that you can remove or shorten. Clutter removes simplicity. Clutter examples:
1. At this point in time, present time, presently, currently, at this juncture of maturization: now
2. Head up, face up, free up, order up: unecessary propositions
3. Personal friend, personal doctor, personal feelings
4. Experiencing
5. Depressed socioeconomic area, waste-disposal personnel: political correctness gone amok
7. Negative cashflow position
8. Assistance: help
9. Numerous: many
10. Facilitate: ease
11. Individual: man or woman
12. Remainder: rest
13. Initial: first
14. Implement: do
15. Sufficient: enough
16. Fire off: send
15. Attempt: try
16. Referred to as: called
16. With the possible exception of: except
17. Due to the fact that: because
19. He totally lacked the ability: he couldn't
20. Until such time: until
21. For the purpose of: for
17. Paradigm, parameter, prioritize, potentialize: jargon
18. I might add, it should be pointed out, it is interesting to note.
20. Tall skyscraper: known fact
21. Smile happily: redundancy
22. A bit, sort of, in a sense.
23. A whole sentence that repeats the previous one in a different way.
23. Greats, notables: adjectives used as nouns.
23. to host, enthuse, emote (latter two are nouns chopped off), beef up, put teeth into (latter two are padded): nouns used as verbs.[^1]
23. Shouldered his way, only to be met, crashing into his face, waging a lonely war, corruption that is rife, sending shock waves, NY Finest: clichés.

[^1]: I noticed that looking up alternatives forces you to be more precise: to entertain, to accomodate, to feed.

Clutter test:
* Is every word doing new work?
* Can any thought be expressed with more economy?
* Is anything pompous, pretensious or faddish?
* Are you hanging on to something because you think it's beautiful?

Stripping down your prose to the essential improves your carpentry. It does not hinder your style. Your style is when you're being yourself with relaxed confidence using good carpentry. Your style is when you are not trying to impress nor indulge the reader.

You owe the reader good carpentry. But you do not owe him your identity. You are using good carpentry in order to show your identity clearly. If the reader leaves because a sentence is illogical, it's on you. But if he leaves because he doesn't think you're funny, it's on him. You owe yourself your honest identity: that's what it means to say you are writing to yourself.

Do not go back to 'style' your writing after you had done it. Style, is not something you can add like lipstick. Your style is in your DNA, so write honestly and without and agenda and your style will show.

Words are the atoms of writing. To write well, you must:
1. Know the gradiations between synonyms: “cajole,” “wheedle,” “blandish” and “coax”[^2]. Use dictionay, thesorus weird thesorous.
2. Imitate a master that you like. Pick a model and ask why did they use this word? Why did they write this sentence like so? How can I write like that?
3. Try to write with your ears and always read your drafts aloud. Pay attention to rhyming, alliteration, cadence and sonority of each sentence[^3].
    * Reassemble the sentence so it ends with a phrase that momentarily lingers.
    * Choose one word after the other because I'm after a certain emotional effect: serene v.s tranquil
    * Gain variety by reversing the order of the sentence
    * Substitute a word that has freshness and oddity. That is oblique, not 'true and tested'.
    * Alter the length of sentences with the occasional short ones. Short sentences could leave a strong punch.

[^2]: Cajole: gentel persuasion. Wheedle: persuation through insincere flatery. Blandish: persuation through skillfull flattery. Coax: persuation through patient means.

[^3]: Example of this: Original: These are the times that try men’s souls. Bad: * Times like these try men’s souls. * How trying it is to live in these times! * These are trying times for men’s souls. * Soulwise, these are trying times.

Usage is a gray area. Only use a word if it fills a real need and there's no better word to use. If a word is jargon don't use it. Examples of bad usage:
* Notables
* Greats
* Upcoming
* -wise suffix like healthwise.
* Rather unique
* myself as in: she invited Sam and myself to dinner.
* 'Too' when substituted for 'very'
* Input and feedback: ideas and what he thinks of them.
* Verbalize

Before you begin your writing, some core decisions need to be made and stuck to. That will establish the unity of your work. Unity is the achor of good writing and communicates confidence to your readers: the author is in charge here. The decisions:
1. Unity of pronoun: first person (participant), second person (advice, teaching) or third person (reporter).
2. Unity of tense: popular past tense? Workable present tense? Pick one as the principle tense and use the past, present and hypothetical future when needed, but also come back to your principle tense.
3. Unity of tone: formal, casual, earnest, understated, or humourous (amongst others).
4. Capacity: reporter, provider of information, average man.
5. Style: Impersonal and reportorial, personal, but formal, personal and casual.
6. Attitude: detached, amused, judgemental, involved or ironic.
7. How much do I want to cover? (Reduce, reduce, reduce).
8. What ONE provocative thought do I want to bring through to the reader after he's done reading? This decision affects several others like tone and attitude and will help with what route you should follow and what destination you hope to reach.

Don't let the material control your unity. Your decisions should control it. But as you're writing, you might find out that the writing is leading you into a better path than what you've decided on. Don't be a prisoner to your plan. Change your strategy. Go back to the material that is using the former decisions and rewrite it to match the better unity.

The lead is marketing for your work. It hooks the reader and pushes him to want to know more. The most important sentence in your lead is the first one. It induces the reader to go to the next one. The next is the one after. Lead length could be from zero (jump into story) to several paragraphs, depending on your material and audience. Good lead characteristics:
* Captures reader immediately by letting them know upfront what's in it for them.
* Uses freshness, novelty, paradox, humor, surprise, unusual idea, interesting fact, a question to keep reader going.
* Provides hard details about why piece was written and why he must read it, but not too much, just enough to keep interest piqued.
* Build up paragraph by paragraph each amplifying the one that precedes it.
* Last sentence of each paragraph must entice reader to read next paragraph. Use surprise, humor,..., see list above.

But remember, the sole purpose of the lead is to hook the reader. If you've done that without any of the above, you're good.

Bad lead characteristics:
* Future archeologist
* Visitor from Mars
* Cute event that just happened to happen: one day, not long ago...
* Conveniently recent Saturday afternoon: ...when he saw something rising out of the ground.
* Have-in-common lead
* Breakfast-to-bed: the alarm rang before sunrize

The ending is as imporant as the lead. It's how you leave your reader feeling. Some tips on endings:
* Do not use the high school structure of Lead, Middle, End (I, II, III) where III summarizes the whole article. When you catch yourself writing: "In sum, it can be noted that...", "What insights then have we been able to glean...".
* Let the ending be a bit abrupt, but exactly right. It should be surprizing.
* If you'd like a sense of symetry, you may touch on the beginning of the piece. A quotation works well here.
* If you're ready to stop, stop. Don't push the ending. The reader will feel you're getting bored.

Verbs are the most important of your tools. Use active ones, unless there's no comfortable way to get around using a passive verb[^4]. Short and precise are better than long and ambiguous. Make active verbs activate your sentences, and avoid the kind that need an appended preposition to complete their work[^5].

[^4]: Joe saw him. He was seen by Joe. Former is strong, latter is weak.
[^5]: Don’t set up a business that you can start or launch. Don’t say that the president of the company stepped down. Did he resign? Did he retire? Did he get fired? Be precise. Use precise verbs.

Most adverbs are unnecessary. Radio blared loudly. Clenched their teeth tightly. Effortlessly easy. Slightly spartan. Totally flabbergasted. Grinned widely. All the previous examples show redundancy. Remove the adverbs and we haven't lost any meaning. Also watch out for decidedly, arguably and their cousins.

Most adjectives are unnessary. When they exist solely as decoration they're self indulgent to the writer and a hindrance to the reader. And when redundant, they're unessary: Yellow daffodils. Brownish dirt. By habit: Stately elms. Firsky kittens. Hard-bitten detectives. Sleepy lagoons. Use them when they're doing real work: "He looked at the gray sky and the black clouds and decided to sail back to the harbor."

Prune out the small words that qualify how you feel and how you think and what you saw: “a bit,” “a little,” “sort of,” “kind of,” “rather,” “quite,” “very,” “too,” “pretty much,” “in a sense” and dozens more. They dilute your style and your persuasiveness. Don't be kind of bold, be bold.

Use the period to save you from long sentence that are doing more than they reasonably can. Like for example expressing two dissimilar thoughts.

Use the dash in two ways. One is to amplify or justify in the second part of the sentence a thought you stated in the first part. “We decided to keep going—it was only 100 miles more and we could get there in time for dinner.” The other use involves two dashes, which set apart a parenthetical thought within a longer sentence. “She told me to get in the car—she had been after me all summer to have a haircut—and we drove silently into town.”

Be prudent in your use of exclamation points, especially when being humorous, they ruin the surprise.

Alert the reader of any mood change from the previous sentence as soon as you can. Use: but, yet, howerver, nevertheless, still, instead, thus therefore, meanwhile, now, later, today, subsequetly and more...Start the new sentence with "but" when shifting direction. If you need some relief from 'but', use 'however', however don't put it at the start or end of sentence, but rather as soon as you can. "Yet" works like "but", but its meaning is closer to nevertheless. Either of those words at the beggining of a sentence can replace a summary of what the reader was told and make your prose tighter:  "Despite the fact that all these dangers had been pointed out to him, he decided to go." becomes "Yet he decided to go" or "Nevertheless he decid to go." The time temporal ones, like now, meanwhile, etc...are for orienting the reader about the time frame: "Later I found out why.", "Now I know better". Always alert the reader of a change from the previous sentence.
