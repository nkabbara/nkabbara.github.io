The secret to success in the names-and-faces event—and to remembering people’s names in the real world—is simply to turn Bakers into bakers—or Foers into fours. Or Reagans into ray guns. It’s a simple trick, but highly effective.

Foer, Joshua. Moonwalking with Einstein: The Art and Science of Remembering Everything (p. 45). (Function). Kindle Edition.
